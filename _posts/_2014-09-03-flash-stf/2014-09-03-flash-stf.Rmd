This tutorial will cover the use of the methods available in [`FLash`](http://www.flr-project.org/FLash) for running Short Term Forecasts (STF). Projections of this kind are commonly carried out after an stock assessment run, in order to inform management decisions on the likely effect of certain levels of exploitation over the short term, e.g. 2-3 years. They can also be part of a Management Procedure, so that a target (biomass, catch, exploitation rate, ...) is set as a result of applying a Harvest Control Rule, and the result of achieving or aiming at that target is computed.

# Introduction


```{r libraries}
library(FLCore)
library(FLAssess)
library(FLash)
library(ggplotFL)
```

## Example dataset: ICES Area 4 North Sea plaice


```{r ple4}
data(ple4)
```

# Setting up the ingredients

There are three necessary ingredients when projecting in FLR an `FLStock` object:

- an assumption about certain future values: maturity, natural mortality, weights-at-age, ...
- a fitted stock-recruitment relationship to predict future recruitment, and
- a control object specifying targets and limits for each time step in the future


# Running a simple three year projection

# Short term forecast with many F scenarios

# Inspecting the results

# Running over a range of scenarios


#---------------------------------------------------------------
# Setting up the stock - assumptions 
#---------------------------------------------------------------

summary(ple4)
# Our ple4 stock goes up to 2008
# We are running a STF forecast - 3 years
# In this example we want to make a 3 year projection
# So we need to extend the stock by 3 years

# The projection will predict abundances in the future
# But what about all the other stock information?
# What will the future:
#   stock weights
#   maturity
#   natural mortality
#   etc.
# look like?

# You need to decide on your assumptions because they will affect the outcome of the projection

# We could use window() or trim() but that makes all future data NA
# For example the future stock weights
stock.wt(window(ple4, end= 2011))


# Instead we use the stf() function (short term forecast)
# This has several options that allow you to control the assumptions about the future
?stf
# These assumptions specify how many years you want to average over to set future values
# For example, wts.nyears is the number of years over which to calculate the *.wt, *.spwn, mat and m slots
# By default this is 3 years
# This is a fairly standard assumption for STFs
# i.e. the future mean weights at age will be the same as the mean of the last 3 years
# This is what we mean by:
# *What is going to happen in the next few years is probably similar to what happened in the last few years* 

# Keep things simple so do a 3 year forecast
```{r}
ple4_stf <- stf(ple4, nyears = 3)
```
# Now the stock goes up to 2011
summary(ple4_stf)
# You can see the future (2009:2011) weights are the mean of the last 3 years (2006:2008)
stock.wt(ple4_stf)
apply(stock.wt(ple4)[,ac(2006:2008)], c(1,3:6), mean)

# Same for maturity etc.
mat(ple4_stf)
apply(mat(ple4)[,ac(2006:2008)], c(1,3:6), mean)

# Another thing important to notice
# The future fishing mortality has also been set (mean of the last 3 years, by default).
harvest(ple4_stf)
apply(harvest(ple4)[,ac(2006:2008)], c(1,3:6), mean)
# In the projections, the harvest slot is used as the selectivity 
# For example you can rescale by the maximum F in each year to look at the future selectivity ogive
sel <- sweep(harvest(ple4_stf), 2:6, apply(harvest(ple4_stf), 2:6, max), "/")
ggplot(sel[,ac(2001:2011)]) + geom_line(aes(x=age, y=data)) + facet_wrap(~year)
ggplot(sel[,ac(2001:2011)]) + geom_line(aes(x=age, y=data, colour = as.factor(year)))

# The final thing to notice is what happened to abundances
# We have no stock abundances - that is the whole point of the projection!
stock.n(ple4_stf)
# We also have no catch abundances
catch.n(ple4_stf)

# But there is something in the landings.n and discards.n slots
landings.n(ple4_stf)
discards.n(ple4_stf)
# The future values (2009 to 2011) are not abundances but ratios
# i.e. what proportion of catch numbers are landed and what are discarded
landings.n(ple4_stf)[,ac(2009:2011)] + discards.n(ple4_stf)[,ac(2009:2011)]
# Int the projection Catch numbers are calculated from F and stock abundance
# These are then split into landings and discards using these ratios

#---------------------------------------------------------------
# The stock-recruitment relationship (SRR)
#---------------------------------------------------------------

# A STF does not use a SRR 
# Instead it assumes that recruitment in the future is the mean of the last X years (normally 3)
# However, we still need to pass the projection a SRR that contains the mean value
# Here we use the mean of the last 3 years

mean_rec <- mean(rec(ple4)[,ac(2006:2008)])

# set up an FLSR object with a geometric mean model
ple4_sr <- as.FLSR(ple4, model="geomean")
# We're not going to fit this model - we're just going to fix the mean value
params(ple4_sr)
params(ple4_sr)['a',] <- mean_rec


#---------------------------------------------------------------
# The control object
#---------------------------------------------------------------

# The final thing we need to set up is the control object
# This tells the projection what to do, i.e. what level of fishing mortality to use

# A standard scenario for a STF is the 'status quo' scenario
# This assumes that the future mean fishing mortality will be the same as the mean of the last X years (X depends on the stock)
# We will set up this scenario as a simple example using a 4 year mean

# Calculate historic Fbar level
# fbar range set in 'range' slot
range(ple4)
fbar(ple4)
ggplot(fbar(ple4), aes(x=year,y=data)) + geom_line()
fbar_status_quo <- mean(fbar(ple4)[,as.character(2005:2008)])

# Now we introduce the control object: fwdControl()
# This takes 1 argument - a data.frame that sets:
#   The year the Fbar target is to be hit 
#   The quantity (or type) of the target (we are using fbar but can also set catch etc. see MTF)
#   The value of the target
#   Some other things that we will ignore for now
# Make the data.frame
ctrl_target <- data.frame(year = 2009:2011,
			  quantity = "f",
			  val = fbar_status_quo)
ctrl_target
# Set the control object - year, quantity and value for the moment
ctrl_f <- fwdControl(ctrl_target)

# Quick tour of the control object
ctrl_f
# We see that we have what looks like our ctrl_target, but now it has two more columns (min and max)
# Also there is another table underneath - ignore this for now - this is for uncertainty which we ignore in STF

#---------------------------------------------------------------
# Running the STF
#---------------------------------------------------------------

# Here we run a simple STF with 'status quo' future fishing mortality
# Remember we had to make assumptions about the future (weights, selection pattern, discard ratio etc.)

# Run fwd() with our three ingredients: the stock, the control object, the SRR
ple4_sq <- fwd(ple4_stf, ctrl = ctrl_f, sr = ple4_sr)
# It returns an updated FLStock object

# What just happened?
summary(ple4_sq)
# fbar in the future is what we wanted in the control object
fbar(ple4_sq)
fbar_status_quo
# And we have predicted abundances
stock.n(ple4_sq)
# So we can calculate predicted abundances (which depends on future assumptions of maturity and stock weight)
ssb(ple4_sq)
# Recruitment in the future years are what we wanted
rec(ple4_sq)
mean_rec

# The future harvest slot is now different to the one we set up
harvest(ple4_stf)[,ac(2009:2011)]
harvest(ple4_sq)[,ac(2009:2011)]
# But the selection pattern is the same - the relative Fs
harvest(ple4_stf)[,ac(2009:2011)] / harvest(ple4_sq)[,ac(2009:2011)]
# F at age has been multiplied by the same value to give us the target Fbar value

# The catch numbers come from the predicted abundance and harvest rates
# Using Baranov
((harvest(ple4_sq) / z(ple4_sq)) * (1 - exp(-z(ple4_sq))) * stock.n(ple4_sq))[,ac(2009:2011)]
catch.n(ple4_sq)[,ac(2009:2011)]

# The catch numbers are then split into landings and discards using the ratios that stf() gave us
# Also landings and discards numbers
landings.n(ple4_sq)
discards.n(ple4_sq)
# These are based on the predicted catch numbers and the discard ratio that stf() gave us
landings.n(ple4_stf)[,ac(2009:2011)]

#---------------------------------------------------------------
# Short term forecast with many F scenarios
#---------------------------------------------------------------

# Typically when running STF you explore several different future F scenarios

# We are going to run several F scenarios for the STF
# The scenarios are based on 'F status quo', which we calculated above as the mean F of the last X years
# For a 3 year STF the F pattern is:
# year 1: fbar_status_quo
# year 2: fbar_status_quo * fbar_multiplier
# year 3: fbar_status_quo * fbar_multiplier
# The fbar_multiplier is the same for years 2 and 3

# The fbar_multiplier ranges from 0.1 to 2 by 0.1
fbar_multiplier <- seq(from = 0, to = 2, by = 0.1)

# We are going to build a data.frame that builds these scenarios
