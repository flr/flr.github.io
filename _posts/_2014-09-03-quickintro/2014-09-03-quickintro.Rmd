# FLR in a nutshell

[![FLR packages](/assets/diagrams/flrpkgs.png)](/assets/diagrams/flrpkgs.png)

# Installing the FLR packages

We start by installing the most recent version of the FLR packages. Most FLR packages are currently not available in [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org), but are distributed through the FLR Project package repository. To install the first of the packages, *FLCore*, please type:

```{r, Install FLR, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('FLCore'), repos='http://flr-project.org/R')
```

# Loading data
```{r}
url <- "http://flr-project.org/assets/data/ple4_ca/ple4_ca.csv"

ca <- read.csv(url)
```
