Abstract = {{Fishery managers must often reconcile conflicting estimates of
   population status and trend. Superensemble models, commonly used in
   climate and weather forecasting, may provide an effective solution. This
   approach uses predictions from multiple models as covariates in an
   additional ``superensemble{''} model fitted to known data. We evaluated
   the potential for ensemble averages and superensemble models (ensemble
   methods) to improve estimates of population status and trend for
   fisheries. We fit four widely applicable data-limited models that
   estimate stock biomass relative to equilibrium biomass at maximum
   sustainable yield (B/BMSY). We combined these estimates of recent
   fishery status and trends in B/BMSY with four ensemble methods: an
   ensemble average and three superensembles (a linear model, a random
   forest and a boosted regression tree). We trained our superensembles on
   5,760 simulated stocks and tested them with cross-validation and against
   a global database of 249 stock assessments. Ensemble methods
   substantially improved estimates of population status and trend. Random
   forest and boosted regression trees performed the best at estimating
   population status: inaccuracy (median absolute proportional error)
   decreased from 0.42 -0.56 to 0.32 -0.33, rank-order correlation between
   predicted and true status improved from 0.02 - 0.32 to 0.44 - 0.48 and
   bias (median proportional error) declined from - 0.22 - 0.31 to - 0.12 -
   0.03. We found similar improvements when predicting trend and when
   applying the simulation-trained superensembles to catch data for global
   fish stocks. Superensembles can optimally leverage multiple model
   predictions; however, they must be tested, formed from a diverse set of
   accurate models and built on a data set representative of the
   populations to which they are applied.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled population dynamics and economic model is applied to the purse
   seine anchovy-fishery in the Gulf of Cadiz. The model simulates the
   population dynamics, landings and profits on a probabilistic frame.
   These simulations are used to assess the biological and economic
   consequences of an individual quota Management framework enveloped by a
   fixed Total Allowable Catch (TAC), the present strategy used to manage
   this stock in the Spanish fishery. Our results accurately indicate that
   this strategy magnifies the biological and economic vulnerabilities
   associated with the exploitation of the stock, thus jeopardizing the
   sustainability of this fishery. Alternative strategies, such as an
   adaptive TAC, are explored. The results indicate that even a basic
   implementation of an adaptive TAC seems more favorable than the present
   strategy in the necessary equilibrium between profits and
   sustainability. This paper provides tools and an assessment that may
   also be useful for other small pelagic fisheries.}},

Abstract = {{The landing obligation policy was one of the major innovations
   introduced in the last Common Fisheries Policy reform in Europe. It is
   foreseen that the policy will affect the use of fishing opportunities
   and hence the economic performance of the fleets. The problem with
   fishing opportunities could be solved if single-stock total allowable
   catches (TACs) could be achieved simultaneously for all the stocks. In
   this study, we evaluate the economic impact of the landing obligation
   policy on the Spanish demersal fleet operating in the Iberian Sea
   region. To generate TAC advice, we used two sets of maximum sustainable
   yield (MSY) reference points, the single-stock MSY reference points
   defined by ICES and a set of multistock reference points calculated
   simultaneously using a bioeconomic optimization model. We found that the
   impact of the landing obligation is time and fleet dependent and highly
   influenced by assumptions about fleet dynamics. At fishery level,
   multistock reference points mitigate the decrease in the net present
   value generated by the implementation of the landing obligation. However
   at fleet level, the effect depends on the fleet itself and the period.
   To ensure the optimum use of fishing opportunities, the landing
   obligation should be accompanied by a management system that guarantees
   consistency between single-stock TACs. In this regard, multistock
   reference points represent an improvement over those currently in use.
   However, further investigation is necessary to enhance performance both
   at fleet level and in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Pretty good yield (PGY) is a sustainable fish yield corresponding to
   obtaining no less than a specified large percentage of the maximum
   sustainable yield (MSY). We investigated 19 European fish stocks to test
   the hypothesis that the 95\% PGY yield range is inherently precautionary
   with respect to impairing recruitment. An F-MSY range was calculated for
   each stock as the range of fishing mortalities (F) that lead to an
   average catch of at least 95\% of MSY in long-term simulations. Further,
   a precautionary reference point for each stock (F-P.05) was defined as
   the F resulting in a 5\% probability of the spawning-stock biomass
   falling below an agreed biomass limit below which recruitment is
   impaired (B-lim) in long-term simulations. For the majority of the
   stocks analysed, the upper bound of the F-MSY range exceeded the
   estimated F-P.05. However, larger fish species had higher precautionary
   limits to fishing mortality, and species with larger asymptotic length
   were less likely to have F-MSY ranges impairing recruitment. Our study
   shows that fishing at F-MSY generally is precautionary with respect to
   impairing recruitment for highly exploited teleost species in northern
   European waters, whereas the upper part of the range providing 95\% of
   MSY is not necessarily precautionary for small-and medium-sized
   teleosts.}},

Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Within the new F-MSY European paradigm, this paper shows how a
   combination of changes in fish stock mixing, non-stationarity in
   productivity, and constraints on unit stock concepts undermine the
   effective management of fisheries, especially when management reference
   points are not adjusted accordingly. Recent changes in stock structures,
   conditions and stock mixing between eastern and western Baltic cod can
   jeopardize the reliability of stock assessments and of the fishery
   economy. We modelled how different management, individual vessel
   decision-making, and stock growth and mixing scenarios have induced
   alternative individual vessel spatial effort allocation and economic
   performance by affecting fishing costs and by changing the relative
   stock abundance and size distribution. Stock mixing heavily influences
   profit and stock abundance for stocks that have experienced increased
   fishing mortality (F) levels. Western cod F has increased from a higher
   total allowed catches (TAC) advised in the medium-term due to the
   westward migration of eastern cod while eastern cod F has increased from
   reduced growth in the east. Greater pressures on western cod and
   decreased eastern cod growth and conditions greatly reduce the overall
   cod spawning stock biomass, thus changing the landing size composition
   and associated fishery profits. As a cumulative effect, fishing efforts
   are redirected towards western areas depending on management (quotas).
   However, total profits are less affected when traditional fishing
   opportunities and switching possibilities for other species and areas
   are maintained. Our evaluation indicates that current management
   mechanisms cannot correct for potential detrimental effects on cod
   fisheries when effort re-allocation changes landing origins. By
   investigating different economic starting conditions we further show
   that Baltic cod mis-management could have resulted in unintended unequal
   (skewed) impacts and serious consequences for certain fleets and fishing
   communities compared with others. Our management strategy evaluation is
   instrumental in capturing non-linear effects of different
   recommendations on sustainability and economic viability, and we show
   that fixed F-values management is likely not an attainable or sufficient
   goal in ensuring the sustainability and viability of fisheries and
   stocks given changing biological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving single species maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in complex and
   dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (mixed fisheries) is
   challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean
   missing the objective for another. The North Sea mixed fisheries are a
   representative example of an issue that is generic across most demersal
   fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries
   inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a
   rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these
   interactions, new approaches have emerged. Recent paths towards
   operationalizing MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion
   of the concept into a desirable area of ``pretty good yield{''},
   implemented through a range around FMSY that would allow for more
   flexibility in management targets. This article investigates the
   potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with
   flexible, short-term, mixed-fisheries management requirements applied to
   the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing
   at the upper bound of the range may lead to unacceptable risks when
   technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that
   provides an optimal set of fishing mortality within the range,
   minimizing the risk of total allowable catch mismatches among stocks
   captured within mixed fisheries, and addressing explicitly the
   trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks.}},

Title = {{Variability and connectivity of plaice populations from the Eastern

   mixing}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A multi-disciplinary study was conducted to clarify stock identity and
   connectivity patterns in the populations of European plaice
   (Pleuronectes platessa) in the Skagerrak-Kattegat transition area
   between the Eastern North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Five independent
   biological studies Were carried out in parallel. Genetic markers
   suggested the existence of different genetic populations in the
   transition area. Growth backcalculation with otoliths resulted in
   significant although limited differences in growth rates between North
   Sea and Skagerrak, indicating weak differentiation or important mixing.
   Hydrogeographical drift modelling suggested that some North Sea
   juveniles could settle along the coast line of the Skagerrak and the
   Kattegat. Tagging data suggested that both juveniles and adult fish from
   the North Sea perform feeding migrations into Skagerrak in
   summer/autumn. Finally, survey data suggested that Skagerrak also
   belongs to the area distribution of North Sea plaice. The outcomes of
   the individual studies were then combined into an overall synthesis. The
   existence of some resident components was evidenced, but it was also
   demonstrated that North Sea plaice migrate for feeding into Skagerrak
   and might constitute a large share of the catches in this area. The
   mixing of different populations within a management area has
   implications for stock assessment and management. Choice must be made to
   either lump or split the populations, and the feasibility and
   constraints of both options are discussed. The outcomes of this work
   have directly influenced the management decisions in 2015. (C) 2016

   The Case of the Aegean Sea}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Management of the Mediterranean demersal stocks has proven challenging
   mainly due to the multi-species character of the fisheries. In the
   present work, we focus on the multi-species demersal fisheries of the
   Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) aiming to study the effects of
   different management measures on the main commercial stocks, as well as
   to explore the economic viability of the fisheries depending upon these
   resources, by means of simulated projections. Utilizing the limited
   available data, our results demonstrated that, under the current
   exploitation pattern, the economic viability of the fleets is
   threatened, particularly if fuel prices increase. Additionally, the
   biological targets set for the most exploited species, such as hake,
   will not be met under the current management regime. The projections
   also showed that the only management scenario under which both resource
   sustainability and economic viability of the fisheries are ensured is
   the decrease of fleet capacity in terms of vessel numbers. In this case,
   however, measures to support the fisheries-dependent communities need to
   be implemented to prevent the collapse of local economies due to
   employment decrease. Scenarios assuming selectivity improvements would
   be also beneficial for the stocks but they showed low economic
   performance and their application would threaten the viability of the
   fleets, particularly that of the trawlers.}},

Title = {{How many of Australia's stock assessments can be conducted using stock
   assessment packages?}},
Journal = {{MARINE POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{279-287}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Most of the stock assessments conducted in the USA and in New Zealand
   are based on packages that have been developed for generic use, are well
   documented, and have been tested using simulation. However, this is not
   the case for assessments conducted in Australia and many other
   countries. This paper reviews all of the model based stock assessments
   for Australian fisheries to evaluate how many of these assessments could
   have been conducted using the publicly-available stock assessment
   packages used widely in the USA and New Zealand. The 76 model-based
   assessments reflect 37\% of the 2013 catch recorded in Australia's
   Status for Key Australian Fish Stocks Reports (or 34\% of the total
   catch in 2013). All but 18 (or 24 if full rather than approximate
   age-size structured models need to be used) of the stock assessments
   could have been conducted using stock assessment packages used in the
   United States and New Zealand. Adoption and use of packages for more
   stocks in Australia should increase the likelihood that results are
   based on correctly-coded models whose estimation performance is widely
   understood, reduce the time needed to conduct assessments, and speed up
   the peer-review process. The availability of training, manuals, and
   example data sets for stock assessment packages should partially address
   their additional complexity. Additional benefits, in terms of numbers of
   assessed stocks, could occur if Australian stock assessment scientists
   develop a forum to collaborate and share methods. These results are
   applicable to many other jurisdictions that undertake stock assessments.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of the prediction skill of stock assessment using hindcasting}},
Journal = {{FISHERIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{119-127}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A major uncertainty in stock assessment is the difference between models
   and reality. The validation of model prediction is difficult, however,
   as fish stocks can rarely be observed and counted. We therefore show how
   hindcasting and model-free validation can be used to evaluate multiple
   measures of prediction skill. In a hindcast a model is fitted to the
   first part of a time series and then projected over the period omitted
   in the original fit. Prediction skill can then be evaluated by comparing
   the predictions from the projection with the observations. We show that
   uncertainty increased when different datasets and hypotheses were
   considered, especially as time-series of model-derived parameters were
   sensitive to model assumptions. Using hindcasting and model-free
   validation to evaluate prediction skill is an objective way to evaluate
   risk, i.e., to identify the uncertainties that matter. A hindcast is
   also a pragmatic alternative to hindsight, without the associated risks.
   While the use of multiple measures helps in evaluating prediction skill
   and to focus research onto the data and the processes that generated
   them. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Landing obligation (LO) has become a core element on the Common
   Fisheries Policy (CFP). In this work a bioeconomic simulation tool is
   used to anticipate the effects of LO in a particular fleet that by its
   nature is likely to be highly affected by its implementation. These
   effects are measured in terms of biologic, economic and fleet
   indicators.
   Results show how LO has a negative short term effect in the economic
   performance of the fleet (the bad). That the exemption and flexibilities
   foreseen in the CFP alleviate, in the short term, the effects of the
   choke species and the redistribution effects created (the good).
   Furthermore, results show that there are private incentives to improve
   the selectivity and to reduce the discard levels of the fleets. It is
   concluded how a breeding ground for a more sustainable and productive
   system is created (very good). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to
   compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives
   of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of
   analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can
   be used to identify a `best' management strategy among a set of
   candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy
   performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management
   achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and
   how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented
   to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE
   therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning
   plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with
   decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This
   paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current `best
   practice' guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best
   practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort
   Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern
   subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).}},

Title = {{An Applied Framework for Incorporating Multiple Sources of Uncertainty
   in Fisheries Stock Assessments}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Estimating fish stock status is very challenging given the many sources
   and high levels of uncertainty surrounding the biological processes
   (e.g. natural variability in the demographic rates), model selection
   (e.g. choosing growth or stock assessment models) and parameter
   estimation. Incorporating multiple sources of uncertainty in a stock
   assessment allows advice to better account for the risks associated with
   proposed management options, promoting decisions that are more robust to
   such uncertainty. However, a typical assessment only reports the model
   fit and variance of estimated parameters, thereby underreporting the
   overall uncertainty. Additionally, although multiple candidate models
   may be considered, only one is selected as the `best' result,
   effectively rejecting the plausible assumptions behind the other models.
   We present an applied framework to integrate multiple sources of
   uncertainty in the stock assessment process. The first step is the
   generation and conditioning of a suite of stock assessment models that
   contain different assumptions about the stock and the fishery. The
   second step is the estimation of parameters, including fitting of the
   stock assessment models. The final step integrates across all of the
   results to reconcile the multi-model outcome. The framework is flexible
   enough to be tailored to particular stocks and fisheries and can draw on
   information from multiple sources to implement a broad variety of
   assumptions, making it applicable to stocks with varying levels of data
   availability The Iberian hake stock in International Council for the
   Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Divisions VIIIc and IXa is used to
   demonstrate the framework, starting from length-based stock and indices
   data. Process and model uncertainty are considered through the growth,
   natural mortality, fishing mortality, survey catchability and
   stock-recruitment relationship. Estimation uncertainty is included as
   part of the fitting process. Simple model averaging is used to integrate
   across the results and produce a single assessment that considers the
   multiple sources of uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Projections of the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems are a
   key prerequisite for the planning of adaptation strategies, yet they are
   inevitably associated with uncertainty. Identifying, quantifying, and
   communicating this uncertainty is key to both evaluating the risk
   associated with a projection and building confidence in its robustness.
   We review how uncertainties in such projections are handled in marine
   science. We employ an approach developed in climate modelling by
   breaking uncertainty down into (i) structural (model) uncertainty, (ii)
   initialization and internal variability uncertainty, (iii) parametric
   uncertainty, and (iv) scenario uncertainty. For each uncertainty type,
   we then examine the current state-of-the-art in assessing and
   quantifying its relative importance. We consider whether the marine
   scientific community has addressed these types of uncertainty
   sufficiently and highlight the opportunities and challenges associated
   with doing a better job. We find that even within a relatively small
   field such as marine science, there are substantial differences between
   subdisciplines in the degree of attention given to each type of
   uncertainty. We find that initialization uncertainty is rarely treated
   explicitly and reducing this type of uncertainty may deliver gains on
   the seasonal-to-decadal time-scale. Weconclude that all parts of marine
   science could benefit from a greater exchange of ideas, particularly
   concerning such a universal problem such as the treatment of
   uncertainty. Finally, marine science should strive to reach the point
   where scenario uncertainty is the dominant uncertainty in our
   projections.}},

Title = {{Reconciling complex system models and fisheries advice: Practical
   examples and leads}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{The move toward an ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) requires
   new operational tools in order to support management decisions. Among
   them, ecosystem-and fisheries-based models are critical to
   quantitatively predict the consequences of future scenarios by
   integrating available knowledge about the ecosystem across different
   scales. Despite increasing development of these complex system models in
   the last decades, their operational use is still currently limited in
   Europe. Many guidelines are already available to help the development of
   complex system models for advice yet they are often ignored. We
   identified three main impediments to the use of complex system models
   for decision support: (1) their very complexity which is a source of
   uncertainty; (2) their lack of credibility, (3) and the challenge of
   communicating/transferring complex results to decision makers not
   accustomed to deal with multivariate uncertain results. In this paper,
   we illustrate these somehow theoretical ``best practices{''} with
   tangible successful examples, which can help the transfer of complex
   system models from academic science to operational advice. We first
   focus on handling uncertainty by optimizing model complexity with
   regards to management objectives and technical issues. We then list up
   methods, such as transparent documentation and performance evaluation,
   to increase confidence in complex system models. Finally, we review how
   and where complex system models could fit within existing institutional
   and legal settings of the current European fisheries decision framework.
   We highlight where changes are required to allow for the operational use
   of complex system models. All methods and approaches proposed are
   illustrated with successful examples from fisheries science or other
   disciplines. This paper demonstrates that all relevant ingredients are
   readily available to make complex system models operational for advice.}},

Abstract = {{Anchovy population dynamics in the Gulf of Cadiz are governed by
   environmental processes. Sea surface temperature, intense easterly
   winds, and discharges from the Guadalquivir River have been identified
   as key factors determining early life stage mortality in this anchovy
   stock. We have constructed an environment-based recruitment model that
   simulates the abundance of juveniles under alternative parameters
   representing plausible biological hypotheses. We are able to evaluate
   how modelling environment-based recruitment can affect stock assessment
   and how responding to environmental information can benefit fishery
   management to allow greater average catch levels through the application
   of harvest control rules (HCRs) based on environmental conditions. While
   the environment-based rules generally increase allowable catch levels
   the variance in catch levels also increases, detracting from the
   improved value based only on average yield. In addition to changes in
   revenue, the probability of stock collapse is also reduced by using
   environmental factors in HCRs. To assess the value of these management
   systems we simulate a notional insurance scheme, which applies a value
   to both average yields and uncertainty. The value of the
   information-driven rules can be determined by comparing the relevant
   premiums payable for equal levels of insurance cover on revenue within
   each specific management regime. We demonstrate the net value of
   incorporating environmental factors in the management of anchovies in
   the Gulf of Cadiz despite the increased variability in revenue. This
   could be an effective method to describe outcomes for both commercial
   fisheries and ecosystem management policies, and as a guide to
   management of other species whose dynamics are predictable based on
   in-season observations.}},

Abstract = {{The appropriateness of three official fisheries management reference
   points used in the north-east Atlantic was investigated: (i) the
   smallest stock size that is still within safe biological limits (SSBpa),
   (ii) the maximum sustainable rate of exploitation (F-msy) and (iii) the
   age at first capture. As for (i), in 45\% of the examined stocks, the
   official value for SSBpa was below the consensus estimates determined
   from three different methods. With respect to (ii), the official
   estimates of F-msy exceeded natural mortality M in 76\% of the stocks,
   although M is widely regarded as natural upper limit for F-msy. And
   regarding (iii), the age at first capture was below the age at maturity
   in 74\% of the stocks. No official estimates of the stock size (SSBmsy)
   that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) are available for
   the north-east Atlantic. An analysis of stocks from other areas
   confirmed that twice SSBpa provides a reasonable preliminary estimate.
   Comparing stock sizes in 2013 against this proxy showed that 88\% were
   below the level that can produce MSY. Also, 52\% of the stocks were
   outside of safe biological limits, and 12\% were severely depleted.
   Fishing mortality in 2013 exceeded natural mortality in 73\% of the
   stocks, including those that were severely depleted. These results point
   to the urgent need to re-assess fisheries reference points in the
   north-east Atlantic and to implement the regulations of the new European
   Common Fisheries Policy regarding sustainable fishing pressure, healthy
   stock sizes and adult age/size at first capture.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of graphical user interfaces for conveying stock
   assessment information within a fisheries simulation model was explored.
   Assessments of stock status for different species and exploitation
   states were presented to workshop participants via alternative user
   interfaces of the same model. Participants then decided how to manage
   these fisheries using various management controls, including size and
   bag limits and temporal and spatial closures. The management decisions
   made by participants for a range of different scenarios were subjected
   to multivariate analyses. When the initial level of exploitation of a
   stock was high, participants typically made stronger and more varied
   management decisions using a wider range of controls than when
   exploitation was less. Although these decisions led to substantial
   reductions in fishing mortality, stock status outcomes were more varied
   and less optimal than those observed for scenarios of low and moderate
   levels of initial exploitation. The trends in decisions made by workshop
   participants probably reflect those that often occur for real-life
   fisheries, in that as fishing pressure increases, management often
   becomes more complex and thus its overall effectiveness may become less
   predictable. Unexpectedly, there were no detectable differences between
   the decisions made by users of alternative interfaces, which varied in
   the amount and complexity of stock assessment outputs provided,
   indicating that the simpler interfaces were as effective as more complex
   interfaces in communicating stock status information. This study
   demonstrates the value of scenariotesting experiments for understanding
   decision making in fisheries management and for assessing whether stock
   assessment information is conveyed to fishery stakeholders in ways that
   can be readily understood.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to establish a relationship between long-term
   variability in sardine and anchovy populations in the Adriatic Sea and
   ocean dynamics and processes that occur over interannual and decadal
   timescales in the Adriatic-Ionian basin. This analysis is based on
   annual time series of sardine and anchovy landings and recruits at age 0
   and annual time series of environmental parameters observed at a
   representative Adriatic station between 1975 and 2010. Pearson
   correlations and robust dynamic factor analysis (DFA) were applied to
   quantify the connections between isheries and environmental parameters.
   Variations and trends in ishery series were best explained by changes in
   near-bottom temperature and salinity, which are an appropriate proxy for
   tracking changes in water mass dynamics and hydrographic conditions in
   the basin. A prolonged period of decreasing sardine population was
   characterized by low oxygen availability and environmental conditions in
   the deep Adriatic waters and was triggered by an extraordinary
   basin-wide event called the Eastern Mediterranean Transient. A collapse
   in anchovy population was observed after an exceptional cooling event
   followed by dense water formation.}},

Volume = {{171}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{12-19}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There are a large number of commercially exploited stocks lacking
   quantitative assessments and reliable estimates of stock status.
   Providing MSY-based advice for these data-limited stocks remains a
   challenge for fisheries science. For many data-limited stocks, catch
   length composition and/or survey biomass indices or catch-per-unit
   effort (cpue) are available. Information on life history traits may also
   be available or borrowed from similar species/stocks. In this work we
   present three harvest control rules (HCRs), driven by indicators derived
   from key monitoring data. These were tested through simulation using two
   exploitation scenarios (development and over-exploitation) applied to 50
   stocks (pelagic, demersal, deep sea species and Nephrops). We examine
   the performance of the HCRs to deliver catch-based advice that is risk
   adverse and drives stocks to MSY. The HCR with a biomass index-adjusted
   status quo catch, used to provide catch-based advice for several
   European data-limited stocks, showed the poorest performance, keeping
   the biomass at low or very low levels. The HCRs that adjust the status
   quo catch based on the variability of the biomass index time series was
   able to drive most of the stocks to MSY, showing low to moderate
   biological risk. The recovery of biomass required asymmetric confidence
   intervals for the biomass index and larger decreases in status quo catch
   than increases. The HCR based on length reference points as proxies for
   the F-SQ/F-msy ratio was able to reverse the decreasing trend in biomass
   but with levels of catch below MSY. This HCR did not prevent some of the
   stocks declining when subject to over-exploitation. For data-limited
   stocks, the empirical HCRs tested in this work can provide the basis for
   catch advice. Nevertheless, applications to real life cases require
   simulation testing to be carried out to tune the HCRs. Our approach to
   simulation testing can be used for such analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Traditional simulation software that supports management decisions is
   configured and run by experienced scientists. However, it is often
   criticised for its lack of interactivity, not only in the application of

   capabilities and its capacity to enable resource managers to learn about
   water quality management as evaluated in a workshop setting. The
   software `MSE Tool' is not intended to produce definitive real-world
   advice but provides a test-bed for managers to interactively design
   strategies and explore the complexities inherent to water quality
   management using a simple, yet effective, user interface. MSE Tool has
   been used in a pilot application that simulated the effects of
   management strategies applied in catchments and their effects on
   riverine, estuarine and marine water quality in South East Queensland,
   Australia. The approach and the software are suitable for reuse in other

Abstract = {{Billfishes, excluding swordfish, are typically not the primary targets
   of large-scale fisheries, which has historically led to a lack of
   targeted monitoring efforts. The lack of data on age-composition,
   missing catch data and species identification problems for some species,
   lack of fishery-independent index data, as well as environmental
   influences on population dynamics is compounded by the international
   nature of how fisheries for billfishes are assessed and managed. This
   paper overviews the most recent assessments conducted for 20 stocks of
   billfishes in the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and how
   management advice is provided for these stocks. Assessments for
   billfishes are conducted using a wide range of techniques, ranging from
   catch-only methods which infer stock status based primarily on the prior
   distributions assumed for the parameters of a population dynamics model,
   to statistical catch-at-age analyses that integrate a wide range of data
   types. Key recommendations arising from this review include that
   age-structured stock assessments should be based on models that allow
   sex-structure to be represented, a full accounting for uncertainty
   requires adequately representing uncertainty regarding growth rates,
   natural mortality, the form and parameters of the stock recruitment
   relationship, and how data are weighted, and that if biomass dynamics
   models are to be applied, they should be based on Bayesian state-space
   formulations rather than observation or process error estimators because
   such formulations are better able to represent uncertainty. Crown

   Trachurus trachurus, and European hake Merluccius merluccius) were
   evaluated. Horse mackerel was the only fish species for which changing
   codends negatively affected landings per unit of effort by large
   percentages. The use of a sorting grid system, only evaluated for blue
   whiting and Norway lobster, led to a strong decrease in landings per
   unit of effort, especially for the former species. The impact of gear
   alterations was negligible on fish spawning-stock biomass, but was
   significant for crustaceans, particularly rose shrimp. A straightforward
   evaluation of the economic impact (fishers' revenues) of the three
   bycatch reduction options showed these to be negligible or small.}},

Abstract = {{Maritime spatial planning (MSP) and fishery management may generate
   extra costs for fisheries by constraining fishers activity with
   conservation areas and new utilizations of the sea. More
   energy-efficient fisheries are also likely to alter existing fishing
   patterns, which already vary from fishery to fishery and from vessel to
   vessel. The impact assessment of new spatial plans involving fisheries
   should be based on quantitative bioeconomic analyses that take into
   account individual vessel decisions, and trade-offs in cross-sector
   conflicting interests. We use a vessel-oriented decision-support tool
   (the DISPLACE model) to combine stochastic variations in spatial fishing
   activities with harvested resource dynamics in scenario projections. The
   assessment computes economic and stock status indicators by modelling
   the activity of Danish, Swedish, and German vessels (> 12 m) in the
   international western Baltic Sea commercial fishery, together with the
   underlying size-based distribution dynamics of the main fishery
   resources of sprat, herring, and cod. The outcomes of alternative
   scenarios for spatial effort displacement are exemplified by evaluating
   the fishers's abilities to adapt to spatial plans under various
   constraints. Interlinked spatial, technical, and biological dynamics of
   vessels and stocks in the scenarios result in stable profits, which
   compensate for the additional costs from effort displacement and release
   pressure on the fish stocks. The effort is further redirected away from
   sensitive benthic habitats, enhancing the ecological positive effects.
   The energy efficiency of some of the vessels, however, is strongly
   reduced with the new zonation, and some of the vessels suffer decreased
   profits. The DISPLACE model serves as a spatially explicit bioeconomic
   benchmark tool for management strategy evaluations for capturing
   tactical decision-making in reaction to MSP.}},

Abstract = {{Tag-recapture data have long been important data sources for fisheries
   management, with the capacity to inform abundance, mortality, growth and
   movement within stock assessments. Historically, this role has been
   fulfilled with low-tech conventional tags, but the relatively recent and
   rapid development of electronic tags has dramatically increased the
   potential to collect more high quality data. Stock assessment models
   have also been evolving in power and complexity recently, with the
   ability to integrate multiple data sources into unified spatially
   explicit frameworks. However, electronic tag technologies and stock
   assessment models have developed largely independently, and frameworks
   for incorporating these valuable data in contemporary stock assessments
   are nascent, at best. Movement dynamics of large pelagic species have
   been problematic to resolve in modern assessments, and electronic tags
   offer new opportunities to resolve some of these issues. Pragmatic ways
   of modeling movement are often not obvious, and basic research into
   discrete and continuous processes, for example, is ongoing. Experimental
   design of electronic tagging research has been driven mostly by
   ecological and biological questions, rather than optimized for stock
   assessment, and this is probably a complicating factor in integration of
   the data into assessment models. A holistic overview of the current
   state of assessment models, electronic tag technologies, and
   experimental design is provided here, with the aim to provide insight
   into how stock assessment and electronic tagging research can be
   conducted most effectively together. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The European eel Regulation EC 1100/2007 establishes measures to recover
   the European eel stock. The Regulation requires Member States to
   guarantee a spawner escapement >= 40\% of pristine levels by reducing
   eel mortality. The complexity and plasticity of eel life history make it
   difficult to assess the effectiveness of alternative management options,
   and tools allowing decision makers and fishermen to quickly assess the
   effectiveness of proposed management scenarios are urgently needed. We
   used state-of-the-art knowledge to develop a user-friendly simulation
   software allowing users to evaluate if current management policies meet
   the conservation target and evaluate the expected performances (spawner
   escapement and fishing yield) of alternative management scenarios. The
   software relies upon a demographic model explicitly accounting for the
   most relevant features of eel demography and has default settings for
   specific geographical areas and water systems. We demonstrate the
   software by exploring a variety of management plans in three European
   water systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural resource managers aim to manage fish stocks at sustainable
   levels. Often, management of these stocks is based on the results of
   analytical stock assessments. Accurate catch data, which can be
   attributed to a specific population unit and reflects the population
   structure, are needed for these approaches. Often though, the quality of
   the catch data is compromised when dealing with a complex population
   structure where fish of different population units mix in a fishery. The
   herring population units west of the British Isles are prone to mixing.
   Here, the inability to perfectly allocate the fish caught to the
   population unit they originate from, due to classification problems,
   poses problems for management. These mixing proportions are often
   unknown; therefore, we use simulation modelling combined with management
   strategy evaluation to evaluate the role fisheries-independent surveys
   can play in an assessment to provide unbiased results, irrespective of
   population unit mixing and classification success. We show that failure
   to account for mixing is one of the major drivers of biased estimates of
   population abundance, affecting biomass reference points and MSY
   targets. When mixing of population units occurs, the role a survey can
   play to provide unbiased assessment results is limited. Either different
   assessment models should be employed or stock status should be
   considered from the survey data alone. In addition, correctly
   classifying the origin of fish is especially important for those
   population units that are markedly smaller in size than other units in
   the population complex. Without high classification success rates,
   smaller population units are extremely vulnerable to overexploitation.}},

Abstract = {{The World Conference on Stock Assessment Methods (July 2013) included a
   workshop on testing assessment methods through simulations. The exercise
   was made up of two steps applied to datasets from 14 representative fish
   stocks from around the world. Step 1 involved applying stock assessments
   to datasets with varying degrees of effort dedicated to optimizing fit.
   Step 2 was applied to a subset of the stocks and involved
   characteristics of given model fits being used to generate pseudo-data
   with error. These pseudo-data were then provided to assessment modellers
   and fits to the pseudo-data provided consistency checks within
   (self-tests) and among (cross-tests) assessment models. Although trends
   in biomass were often similar across models, the scaling of absolute
   biomass was not consistent across models. Similar types of models tended
   to perform similarly (e.g. age based or production models). Self-testing
   and cross-testing of models are a useful diagnostic approach, and
   suggested that estimates in the most recent years of time-series were
   the least robust. Results from the simulation exercise provide a basis
   for guidance on future large-scale simulation experiments and
   demonstrate the need for strategic investments in the evaluation and
   development of stock assessment methods.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, scientists providing advice to fisheries managers have
   been granted access to an increasing range of spatio-temporal data from
   fishing vessels, using tools such as vessel monitoring systems and
   electronic observation platforms. This information should allow for the
   provision of more germane advice on the activity of vessels, and hence
   the likely impact of management measures which are becoming increasingly
   spatial in nature. However, the development of appropriate management
   simulation and assessment models has lagged behind the availability of
   these new data. This paper presents an accessible spatio-temporal
   simulation framework (Honeycomb) which features a weekly time-step,
   multiple stocks and vessels, and economic decision rules and applies
   this to a case study of a spatial evaluation of a simple closed-area
   fishery policy. We conclude that the development and utilization of such
   spatio-temporal simulation models is a key research task for fisheries
   in which both spatial fisheries data and spatial fisheries management
   are becoming paramount.}},

Title = {{Improving the performance of a Mediterranean demersal fishery toward
   economic objectives beyond MSY}},
Journal = {{FISHERIES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{161}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Mediterranean demersal fisheries are highly multispecific and many of
   their target stocks are overexploited. In addition, rocketing fuel costs
   and low market prices of traditionally high-value species are
   challenging the viability of fisheries. Here, based on the numeric
   results of a simulation model, we conclude that this situation can be
   remedied by reducing both fishing mortality and fishing costs. According
   to our model results, fishing effort reductions of 48-71\% would improve
   the health of fish stocks while increasing the economic profits of
   Mallorca islands bottom trawl fishery to as much as 1.9 M(sic) (146\%
   higher than current profits). If all fish stocks were exploited at their
   MSY (or below) level, the reduction in fishing effort would have to be
   of 71\% from current values. If equilibrium profits from the fishery
   were to be maximized (MEY), fishing effort would need to be reduced by
   48\%. These results must be taken with caution due the many sources of
   uncertainty of our analysis. The modeling tools used to estimate these
   values are conditional to the adequate treatment of two sources of
   uncertainty that are particularly problematic in Mediterranean
   fisheries: insufficiently known recruitment variability and lack of
   periodic evaluations of the state of many species. Our results show that
   fishing effort reductions would produce economic yield gains after a
   period of transition. Further studies on the benefits of changing the
   size-selection pattern of fisheries, on better estimation of stock
   recruitment relationships and on better quantifications of the
   contribution of secondary species to these fisheries, are expected to
   improve the scientific recommendations for Mediterranean demersal
   fisheries toward sustainability principles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{ss3sim: An R Package for Fisheries Stock Assessment Simulation with
   Stock Synthesis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{Simulation testing is an important approach to evaluating fishery stock
   assessment methods. In the last decade, the fisheries stock assessment
   modeling framework Stock Synthesis (SS3) has become widely used around
   the world. However, there lacks a generalized and scriptable framework
   for SS3 simulation testing. Here, we introduce ss3sim, an R package that
   facilitates reproducible, flexible, and rapid end-to-end simulation
   testing with SS3. ss3sim requires an existing SS3 model configuration
   along with plain-text control files describing alternative population
   dynamics, fishery properties, sampling scenarios, and assessment
   approaches. ss3sim then generates an underlying `truth' from a specified
   operating model, samples from that truth, modifies and runs an
   estimation model, and synthesizes the results. The simulations can be
   run in parallel, reducing runtime, and the source code is free to be
   modified under an open-source MIT license. ss3sim is designed to explore
   structural differences between the underlying truth and assumptions of
   an estimation model, or between multiple estimation model
   configurations. For example, ss3sim can be used to answer questions
   about model misspecification, retrospective patterns, and the relative
   importance of different types of fisheries data. We demonstrate the
   software with an example, discuss how ss3sim complements other
   simulation software, and outline specific research questions that ss3sim
   could address.}},

Title = {{Assessing the Impact of Policy Changes in the Icelandic Cod Fishery
   Using a Hybrid Simulation Model}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Most of the Icelandic cod is caught in bottom trawlers or longliners.
   These two fishing methods are fundamentally different and have different
   economic, environmental, and even social effects. In this paper we
   present a hybrid-simulation framework to assess the impact of changing
   the ratio between cod quota allocated to vessels with longlines and
   vessels with bottom trawls. It makes use of conventional bioeconomic
   models and discrete event modelling and provides a framework for
   simulating life cycle assessment (LCA) for a cod fishery. The model
   consists of two submodels, a system dynamics model describing the
   biological aspect of the fishery and a discrete event model for fishing
   activities. The model was run multiple times for different quota
   allocation scenarios and results are presented where different scenarios
   are presented in the three dimensions of sustainability: environmental,
   social, and economic. The optimal allocation strategy depends on
   weighing the three different factors. The results were encouraging
   first-steps towards a useful modelling method but the study would
   benefit greatly from better data on fishing activities.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) into a fishery
   is going to change not only the amount of catch a fleet can take, but
   often also changes the fleet structure, particularly if total allowable
   catches are decreased. This can have an impact on the economic, social
   and environmental outcomes of fisheries management. Management Strategy
   Evaluation (MSE) modelling approaches are recognised as the most
   appropriate method for assessing impacts of management, but these
   require information as to how fleets may change under different
   management systems. In this study, we test the applicability of data
   envelopment analysis (DEA) based performance measures as predictors of
   how a fishing fleet might change under the introduction of ITQs and also
   at different levels of quota. In particular, we test the assumption that
   technical efficiency and capacity utilisation are suitable predictors of
   which boats are likely to exit the fishery. We also consider scale
   efficiency as an alternative predictor. We apply the analysis to the
   Torres Strait tropical rock lobster fishery that is transitioning to an
   ITQ-based management system for one sector of the fishery. The results
   indicate that capacity utilisation, technical efficiency and scale
   efficiency are reasonable indicators of who may remain in the fishery
   post ITQs. We find that the use of these measures to estimate the
   impacts of lower quota levels provides consistent fleet size estimates
   at the aggregate level, but which individual vessels are predicted to
   exit is dependent on the measure used. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Cod, haddock and herring in the Barents Sea have strongly variable
   recruitment. For these three stocks, earlier studies have suggested a
   high correlation between their recruitment and a positive relationship
   between high temperatures and good recruitment. These hypotheses were
   revisited using stock assessment and temperature data for the period
   1913-present. The cod-haddock and herring-haddock recruitment
   correlations were both significant and positive in some periods, but
   became insignificant towards the end of the period. Cod and herring
   recruitment was not significantly correlated. Recruitment variability
   was found to decline towards the end of the period for all species, in
   particular for cod. For all three stocks there is a significant positive
   relationship between recruitment and temperature; this relationship is
   strongest for haddock and weakest for herring. Recruitment was found to
   be low at low temperatures and variable at medium/high temperatures
   during the first year of life for all three species. Temperature during
   the first winter of life correlates positively with haddock and cod
   recruitment residuals. This correlation is weakened towards the end of
   the period for cod, but stays high for haddock. Temperature during the
   first summer of life correlates positively with herring recruitment
   during some parts of the period, but also this correlation is weakened
   towards the end of the period.}},

Abstract = {{Deepwater fish are characterized by long lifespans, late maturity and
   low productivity. This implies slow recovery from low biomass levels and
   it is, therefore, important to manage these stocks correctly to avoid
   overfishing. However, these stocks are generally data poor, which it
   makes difficult to apply quantitative assessment models on which to base
   their management. The management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach
   consists in evaluating the performance of management strategies by
   simulation before their implementation. In the evaluation, the main
   sources of uncertainty in a fishery system and its management process
   should be taken into account in order to find robust management
   strategies. Thus, the MSE approach is relevant to the management of
   data-poor stocks. We used the FLBEIA software, an FLR library coded in
   the R statistical language, to conduct a bio-economic impact assessment
   of fisheries management strategies. We evaluated the performance of
   several management strategies in three different deepwater case studies
   using the MSE approach: beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) in the
   Norwegian Sea, blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) in the Strait of
   Gibraltar, and French mixed deepwater fisheries in the North East
   Atlantic. In conclusion, we found that the S. mentella stock is very
   sensitive to the stock recruitment relationship chosen. For P.
   bogaraveo, simulations showed that the present constant catch management
   is as good as more sophisticated strategies. Finally, in mixed
   fisheries, case study fleet dynamics were key for the success of
   management strategies}},

Abstract = {{1. Spatial management is used extensively in natural resource management
   to address sustainability and biodiversity issues, for example through
   declaration of terrestrial National Parks and marine protected areas
   (MPAs).
   2. Spatial management is used also to optimize yields or protect key
   parts of the life cycle of species that are utilized (hunted, farmed or
   fished), for example through rotational harvesting.
   3. To evaluate the effectiveness of marine spatial closures with
   conflicting fisheries and conservation objectives, a series of marine
   fisheries closures are here analysed using an integrative modelling tool
   known as management strategy evaluation (MSE).
   4. This modelling framework combines a food web model of a tropical
   ecosystem fished by a prawn (shrimp) fishery that emulates the resource
   being managed, together with the present management system and
   risk-based tools of fishing the prawn species at maximum economic yield.
   5. A series of spatial closures are designed and tested with the aim of
   investigating trade-offs among biodiversity (MPA), benthic impacts,
   ecosystem function, key species at risk to fishing, economic and
   sustainability objectives.
   6. Synthesis and applications. This paper illustrates that existing
   tools often available in actively managed fisheries can be linked
   together into an effective management strategy evaluation framework.
   Spatial closures tended to succeed with respect to their specific design
   objective, but this benefit did not necessarily flow to other
   broad-scale objectives. This demonstrates that there is no single
   management tool which satisfies all objectives, and that a suite of
   management tools is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Wehave used in this study a spatially explicit bioeconomic modelling
   framework to evaluate management strategies, building in both datarich
   and data-limited harvest control rules (HCRs), for a mix of deepwater
   fleets and species, on which information is variable. The main focus was
   on blue ling (Molva dypterygia). For that species, both data-rich and
   data-limited HCRs were tested, while catch per unit effort (CPUE) was
   used either to tune stock assessments, or to directly trigger management
   action. There were only limited differences between the performances of
   both HCRs when blue ling biomass was initialized at the current level,
   but blue ling recovered more quickly with the data-rich HCR when its
   initial biomass was severely depleted. Both types of HCR lead, on
   average, to a long-term recovery of both blue ling and saithe
   (Pollachius virens) stocks, and some increase in overall profit.
   However, that improvement is not sufficient to guarantee sustainable
   exploitation with a high probability. Blue ling CPUE did not always
   adequately reflect trends in biomass, which mainly resulted from fleet
   dynamics, possibly in combination with density-dependence. The stock
   dynamics of roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black
   scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) and deepwater sharks (Centrophorus
   squamosus and Centroscymnus coelolepis) were little affected by the type
   of HCR chosen to manage blue ling.}},

Abstract = {{For several decades it has been acknowledged that there is an urgent
   need for new approaches to fisheries management, embracing conservation
   and environmental considerations. The voluntary Code of Conduct on
   Responsible Fishing and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement provide
   the formal basis for the Precautionary Approach to fisheries management.
   Some tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations such as the WCPFC
   and IATTC make explicit mention of these codes in their conventions,
   whilst others, whose conventions do not explicitly address the
   Precautionary Approach, are searching for ways in which to take these
   codes into consideration. In practical terms, the scientific obligations
   to Precautionary Approaches are to determine the status of the stock(s)
   relative to limit and target reference points, to predict outcomes of
   management alternatives for reaching the targets and avoiding the
   limits, and to characterise the uncertainty in both cases. A convenient
   framework to conduct management evaluations is through the use of
   harvest control rules, for which managers agree on specific management
   actions under their control which are evoked according to levels of
   stock status relative to predefined reference points. These pre-agreed
   management actions are then simulated for a range of scenarios. This
   paper presents the ways in which tuna RFMOs are currently incorporating
   the precautionary approach in their fisheries management as well as
   suggestions for possible best practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Management of fisheries for sustainability requires dealing with
   multiple and often conflicting objectives. A stochastic viability
   approach is proposed to address the trade-offs associated with balancing
   ecological, economic and social objectives in regulating mixed
   fisheries, taking into account the complexity and uncertainty of the
   dynamic interactions which characterize such fisheries. We focus on the
   demersal fishery in the Bay of Biscay and more specifically on the
   fleets harvesting Norway Lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), Hake (Merluccius
   merluccius) and Sole (Solea solea). A bio-economic multi-species and
   multi-fleet model with technical interactions is developed to examine
   the trade-offs between preserving Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) of every
   species and maintaining the economic profitability of the various
   fishing fleets. Different management strategies are tested and compared.
   Results suggest that ensuring viability of this demersal fishery
   requires a significant decrease in fishing capacity as compared to the
   reference year. The simulations allow comparing the trade-offs
   associated with different allocations of this decrease across fleets.

Abstract = {{The inconsistency of single-species objectives in a mixed-fisheries
   context has repeatedly been highlighted as a key issue in the current
   European Common Fishery Policy, and it has long been suggested that this
   issue would be better addressed through fleet (group of vessels) and m
   tier (type of activity) - based approaches. Since the late 1980s. when
   such approaches were first introduced, there have been substantial
   developments in this area of science, to the point where the concepts of
   fleet and m tier now underpin the whole EC Data Collection Framework.
   However, their implementation in the management system has been slow and
   difficult, being hampered by a number of intrinsic issues. Mixed
   fisheries are an ongoing ``governance headache{''} combining management
   complexity, scientific uncertainty and political sensitivity.
   This paper summarises the current state of play for fleet-based
   approaches in EU fisheries management, and highlights our views on both
   their potential and the challenges they face in the context of the
   future CFP. As a convenient layer between the current single-stock level
   and the level of the individual vessel, fleet/metier- approaches could
   potentially address a wide range of issues, especially with regards to
   the policy emphasis on ecosystem-based fisheries management. However,
   the rigid categorisation they induce may not properly address the
   flexibility of individual vessels, and should therefore be supplemented
   by more detailed considerations at the local scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The reform of the European Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) aims to
   restores and maintains fish resources at levels which can produce the
   maximum sustainable yield (MSY) not later than 2015. In this paper we
   show why if MSY is used as reference point, optimal management may
   entail pulse fishing. This means that current management of the European
   fisheries is based on metrics that may generate solutions that would not
   be accepted as feasible due to the large social costs implied. We
   discuss why changes in the metrics used to define the reference point
   (the logMSY) and/or optimal harvesting control rules that stabilize the
   employment and the biomass around the optimal stationary values are two
   possible solutions of this paradox. The European Union should take into
   account all these considerations for the CFP reform proposals. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Using an exploitation rate (not fishing mortality) based virtual

   the Pope approximation to the original VPA equations, I show how to
   derive variance estimates for the key VPA outputs (recruitment, SSB,
   exploitation rates) given variance information on the key inputs
   (catch-at-age/terminal exploitation rates). Given the alternative VPA
   algorithm permits closed-form solutions for the outputs in terms of the
   inputs, the delta method is employed to obtain the variance estimates,
   removing the need for complex simulation techniques. Using North Sea
   herring data as an example, the methods utility is demonstrated by
   exploring the impact of aging error in the catch data and tuning error
   on the precision of estimates of SSB, recruitment and exploitation
   rates, and the parameters of the stock-recruit relationship.}},

Abstract = {{How can uncertain fisheries science be linked with good governance
   processes, thereby increasing fisheries management legitimacy and
   effectiveness? Reducing the uncertainties around scientific models has
   long been perceived as the cure of the fisheries management problem.
   There is however increasing recognition that uncertainty in the numbers
   will remain. A lack of transparency with respect to these uncertainties
   can damage the credibility of science. The EU Commission's proposal for
   a reformed Common Fisheries Policy calls for more self-management for
   the fishing industry by increasing fishers' involvement in the planning
   and execution of policies and boosting the role of fishers'
   organisations. One way of higher transparency and improved participation
   is to include stakeholders in the modelling process itself. The JAKFISH
   project (Judgment And Knowledge in Fisheries Involving StakeHolders)
   invited fisheries stakeholders to participate in the process of framing
   the management problem, and to give input and evaluate the scientific
   models that are used to provide fisheries management advice. JAKFISH
   investigated various tools to assess and communicate uncertainty around
   fish stock assessments and fisheries management. Here, a synthesis is
   presented of the participatory work carried out in four European fishery
   case studies (Western Baltic herring, North Sea Nephrops, Central Baltic
   Herring and Mediterranean swordfish), focussing on the uncertainty tools
   used, the stakeholders' responses to these, and the lessons learnt. It
   is concluded that participatory modelling has the potential to
   facilitate and structure discussions between scientists and stakeholders
   about uncertainties and the quality of the knowledge base. It can also
   contribute to collective learning, increase legitimacy, and advance
   scientific understanding. However, when approaching real-life
   situations, modelling should not be seen as the priority objective.
   Rather, the crucial step in a science-stakeholder collaboration is the
   joint problem framing in an open, transparent way. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   studies the fisheries targeting short-lived Japanese common squid

Abstract = {{The ecosystem approach (EA) advocates that advice should be given based
   on a holistic management of the entire marine ecosystem and all
   fisheries and fleets involved. Recent developments have advanced to
   multi-species, multi-fisheries advice, rather than on a
   single-species/fleet/area stock basis, bridging the gap between existing
   single-species approaches and the needs of the EA. The Fleet and
   Fisheries Forecast method (Fcube) method estimates potential levels of
   effort by fleet in mixed fisheries situations to achieve specific
   targets of fishing mortality. Data on effort, landings and socioeconomic
   parameters were used for coastal and trawl fisheries in the Aegean Sea.
   Results pointed out the strengths and weaknesses of alternative
   management strategies from both a biological and socioeconomic
   perspective. Fcube revealed the importance of effort control in the
   coastal fisheries that are still managed with no effort restrictions.
   The present findings, although preliminary, revealed that stringent cuts
   to effort and catch levels are required if EA management goals are to be
   met. The Fcube methodology, initially developed for mixed fisheries
   advice in northern European waters that are managed with TACs, also
   proved promising in providing advice to non-TAC fisheries.}},

   discounted revenue, the probability of overfishing (i. e. the catch
   exceeding the true, but unknown, limit catch), and the stock becoming
   overfished (i. e. for crab, mature male biomass, MMB, dropping below
   one-half of the MMB corresponding to maximum sustainable yield). This
   approach can be applied when only a fraction of the uncertainty related
   to estimating the limit catch level is quantified through stock
   assessments. The approach is applied for illustrative purposes to the

Abstract = {{VMStools is a package of open-source software, build using the freeware
   environment R. specifically developed for the processing, analysis and
   visualisation of landings (logbooks) and vessel location data (VMS) from
   commercial fisheries. Analyses start with standardized data formats for
   logbook (EFLALO) and VMS (TACSAT), enabling users to conduct a variety
   of analyses using generic algorithms. Embedded functionality handles
   erroneous data point detection and removal, m tier identification
   through the use of clustering techniques, linking logbook and VMS data
   together in order to distinguish fishing from other activities, provide
   high-resolution maps of both fishing effort and -landings, interpolate
   vessel tracks, calculate indicators of fishing impact as listed under
   the Data Collection Framework at different spatio-temporal scales.
   Finally data can be transformed into other existing formats, for example
   to populate regional databases like FishFrame. This paper describes
   workflow examples of these features while online material allows a head
   start to perform these analyses. This software incorporates state-of-the
   art VMS and logbook analysing methods standardizing the process towards
   obtaining pan-European, or even worldwide indicators of fishing
   distribution and impact as required for spatial planning. (c) 2011

Journal = {{AQUATIC BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{31-52}},
Abstract = {{Effective monitoring of populations and communities is a prerequisite
   for ecosystem-based management of marine areas. However, monitoring
   programs often neglect important sources of error and thus can lead to
   biased estimates, spurious conclusions and false management actions. One
   such source of error is `imperfect detectability', i.e. the inability of
   investigators to detect all individuals or all species in a surveyed
   area. Although there has been great effort to develop monitoring methods
   that account for imperfect detectability, the application of such
   methods in the marine environment is not as apparent as in other
   systems. Plot sampling is by far the most commonly applied method for
   biological monitoring in the marine environment, yet it largely ignores
   detectability issues. However, distance sampling, mark-recapture
   methods, repeated presence-absence surveys for occupancy estimation, and
   removal methods do estimate detection probabilities and provide unbiased
   estimates of state variables. We review these methods and the relevant
   tools for their application in studies on marine populations and
   communities, with the aim of assisting marine biologists and managers to
   understand the limitations and pitfalls associated with some approaches
   and to select the best available methods for their monitoring needs.}},

   with Special Reference to Deepwater and Data-Poor Stocks}},
Journal = {{REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{136-153}},
Abstract = {{Deepwater fish populations are often characterized by their life-history
   as being highly susceptible to overexploitation. Moreover, dependent
   fisheries often develop rapidly, so overexploitation may occur before
   resource dynamics are quantified sufficiently to assess safe biological
   limits. It is therefore crucial to employ assessment methods that make
   the best use of limited data and management procedures that account for
   large uncertainties. This review provides a critical synthesis of
   assessment and management approaches for deepwater fisheries. Given
   limitations in the data, it is clear that assessments are likely to
   benefit from the application of derived relationships between
   life-history characteristics and the sharing of this and other
   information across stocks. It is important that uncertainty in
   assessment results is represented adequately, and management methods
   must in turn ensure that decision mechanisms are robust to an incomplete
   picture of resource dynamics. This requires construction and testing of
   harvest control rules within a simulation framework. Harvest control
   rules themselves, however, need not be complicated, and simple empirical
   approaches can be adequate for situations in which only relative changes
   in biomass can be discerned from the data. Development and testing of
   these control rules is likely to prove a productive area of future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to describe the biometric characteristics of
   European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) catches and assess the current
   status of sardine stock in the North Aegean Sea based on population
   characteristics and abundance trends. The stock was dominated by age
   groups 1 and 2, not exceeding age group 4. The sardine stock in this
   area was assessed through an Integrated Catch-at-Age model which
   implements a separable Virtual Population Analysis on catch-at-age data
   with weighted tuning indices. Sardine landings data derived from the
   commercial purse seine fishery over the period 2000-2008 were combined
   with the age structure of the stock as resulting from fisheries'
   independent acoustic surveys. Sensitivity analysis of the impact of
   natural mortality values on stock assessment results was applied.
   Additionally forecast of the sardine population parameters and catches
   under different exploitation scenarios was implemented on a medium term
   basis. Results indicated that the North Aegean Sea sardine stock is
   considered fully exploited, with the fishery operating close to, but
   over the empirical exploitation level for sustainability. Finally, the
   status of the sardine stock in the North Aegean Sea is discussed in
   relation to the sardine stocks from the western and the central
   Mediterranean basin.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of the fishing effort exerted by a vessel on a population
   depends on catchability, which depends on population accessibility and
   fishing power. The work investigated whether the variation in fishing
   power could be the result of the technical characteristics of a vessel
   and/or its gear or whether it is a reflection of inter-vessel
   differences not accounted for by the technical attributes. These
   inter-vessel differences could be indicative of a skipper/crew
   experience effect. To improve understanding of the relationships,
   landings per unit effort (lpue) from logbooks and technical information
   on vessels and gears (collected during interviews) were used to identify
   variables that explained variations in fishing power. The analysis was
   undertaken by applying a combination of generalized additive models and
   generalized linear models to data from several European fleets. The
   study highlights the fact that taking into account information that is
   not routinely collected, e. g. length of headline, weight of otter
   boards, or type of groundrope, will significantly improve the modelled
   relationships between lpue and the variables that measure relative
   fishing power. The magnitude of the skipper/crew experience effect was
   weaker than the technical effect of the vessel and/or its gear.}},

Abstract = {{The poor management of natural resources has led in many cases to the
   decline and extirpation of populations. Recent advances in fisheries
   science could revolutionize management of harvested stocks by evaluating
   management scenarios in a virtual world by including stakeholders and by
   assessing its robustness to uncertainty. These advances have been
   synthesized into a framework, management strategy evaluation (WISE),
   which has hitherto not been used in terrestrial conservation. We review
   the potential of MSE to transform terrestrial conservation, emphasizing
   that the behavior of individual harvesters must be included because
   harvester compliance with management rules has been a major challenge in
   conservation. Incorporating resource user decision-making required to
   make MSEs relevant to terrestrial conservation will also advance

Abstract = {{The potential role of coupled biophysical models in enhancing the
   conservation, management, and recovery of fish stocks is assessed, with
   emphasis on anchovy, cod, herring, and sprat in European waters. The
   assessment indicates that coupled biophysical models are currently
   capable of simulating transport patterns, along with temperature and
   prey fields within marine ecosystems; they therefore provide insight
   into the variability of early-life-stage dynamics and connectivity
   within stocks. Moreover, the influence of environmental variability on
   potential recruitment success may be discerned from model hindcasts.
   Based on case studies, biophysical modelling results are shown to be
   capable of shedding light on whether stock management frameworks need
   re-evaluation. Hence, key modelling products were identified that will
   contribute to the development of viable stock recovery plans and
   management strategies. The study also suggests that approaches combining
   observation, process knowledge, and numerical modelling could be a
   promising way forward in understanding and simulating the dynamics of
   marine fish populations.}},

Abstract = {{Single-species management is a cause of discarding in mixed fisheries,
   because individual management objectives may not be consistent with each
   other and the species are caught simultaneously in relatively
   unselective fishing operations. As such, the total allowable catch (TAC)
   of one species may be exhausted before the TAC of another, leading to
   catches of valuable fish that cannot be landed legally. This important
   issue is, however, usually not quantified and not accounted for in
   traditional management advice. A simple approach using traditional catch
   and effort information was developed, estimating catch potentials for
   distinct fleets (groups of vessels) and metiers (type of activity), and
   hence quantifying the risks of over-and underquota utilization for the
   various stocks. This method, named Fcube (Fleet and Fisheries Forecast),
   was applied successfully to international demersal fisheries in the
   North Sea and shaped into the advice framework. The substantial
   overquota catches of North Sea cod likely under the current fisheries
   regimes are quantified, and it is estimated that the single-species
   management targets for North Sea cod cannot be achieved unless
   substantial reductions in TACs of all other stocks and corresponding
   effort reductions are applied.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature effects on Baltic sprat are many and include both direct and
   indirect effects. Increasing temperature is thought to increase the
   survival of all early life stages, resulting in increased recruitment
   success. We quantified the spatially resolved temperature trend for
   major spawning grounds and depth layers being most relevant for sprat
   eggs and larvae, using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for
   1979-2005. Results confirmed an underlying positive temperature trend.
   Next, we tested these time-series as new explanatory variables in an
   existing temperature-dependent recruitment function and applied these
   recruitment predictions in an age-structured ecological economic
   optimization model, maximizing for profit. Economic optimal solutions
   depended upon variability in temperature trajectories. Under
   climate-change scenarios, mean optimal fishing mortality and related
   yields and profits increased. The extent of the increase was limited by
   the general shape of the stock recruitment model and the assumption of
   density-dependence. This highlights the need to formulate better
   environmentally sensitive stock recruitment models. Under the current
   knowledge of Baltic sprat recruitment, the tested climate-change
   scenarios would result in a change in management targets. However, to
   serve as a quantitative management advice tool, models will have to
   address the above-mentioned concerns.}},

Abstract = {{The European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) is a short-lived pelagic
   species distributed in Atlantic European waters, with the Bay of Biscay
   being one of the main centres of abundance. Because it is a short-lived
   species, the state of the stock is determined largely by incoming
   recruitment. Recruitment is highly variable and depends on a variety of
   factors, such as the size of the spawning stock and environmental
   conditions in the area. The use of a coupled model that could serve to
   predict the evolution of the anchovy stock in the short, medium, and
   long term under several fishing-pressure scenarios and given climate
   scenarios is demonstrated. This coupled model consists of a Gadget
   (Globally Applicable Disaggregated General Ecosystem Toolbox) model that
   was used to analyse the status of the Bay of Biscay anchovy population
   and to simulate future scenarios based on the estimated recruitment
   levels, combined with a probabilistic Bayesian network model for
   recruitment estimation based on machine-learning methods and using
   climatic indices as potential forecasting factors. The results indicate
   that certain combinations of medium to high fishing pressure and adverse
   environmental conditions could force the stock outside its biological
   reference boundaries.}},

Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{Since 2004 management of the Northern Stock of European Hake has been
   focused on recovering the stock level up to a level consistent with the
   precautionary approach. After that, in 2007 and once this objective was
   on the track of being fulfilled a long term management plan was
   proposed. This plan has to be congruent with the maximum sustainable
   yield policy as well as producing stable yields and population levels.
   Thus, in that year, a bioeconomic impact assessment of long-term
   management plans for this stock was carried out. However the biological
   and economic assessments were not integrated and not fully congruent. On
   the basis of this assessment additional questions relating to the
   combination of harvest control rules with technical measures were raised
   by the managers and stakeholders.
   Here, the model used in the biological assessment is extended in order
   to integrate the economic part and to shed light on the effect of
   technical measures at stock and fleet level. Two scenarios are
   presented: a `base case', where the model is parameterized from
   historical observations; and an `alternative case' where an increase in
   the mesh size of some trawlers is simulated.
   In both scenarios the probability of falling below limit reference
   points is above 0, contrary to the result obtained in 2007. However, the
   relative trends of the median of population indicators are similar.
   While the biological performance of the base and alternative scenarios
   is also similar the trawlers are highly penalized when their mesh size
   is increased and the overall economic profit is lower. Furthermore, two
   fleets gain and the rest remain the same with the increase in the mesh
   size of trawlers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the question of which quantitative modelling tools can be
   used to support an ecosystem approach to management (EAM), with a focus
   on evaluating the implication of decisions on the biological system
   being managed. Managers of federal fisheries in the eastern Bering Sea,
   USA, have adopted an EAM. The tools used to support EAM in the eastern
   Bering Sea serve as a guide to what types of models could be used
   elsewhere. A review of the role of natural science in the implementation
   of EAM shows that scientific advice enters into decision-making at a
   variety of steps. Single-species stock assessment and projection models
   are the most commonly used tools employed to inform managers.
   Comprehensive assessments (e.g. management strategy evaluation) are
   emerging as a new and potentially valuable analysis technique for use in
   assessing trade-offs of different strategic alternatives. In the case of
   management in the eastern Bering Sea, end-to-end models and coupled
   biophysical models have been used primarily to advance scientific
   understanding, but have not been applied in a management context. This
   review highlights that implementation of an EAM in a management
   environment such as eastern Bering Sea requires substantial commitments
   to the collection and analysis of data and support for a group of
   analysts with interdisciplinary training in population dynamics,
   oceanography and ecology. This review supports the growing recognition
   that a diverse suite of modelling tools is needed to address tactical
   and strategic management issues germane to the adoption of the ecosystem
   approach to fisheries management.}},

Abstract = {{Management strategy evaluation (MSE) was used to test the assessment and
   management performance of three assessment methods in combination with
   harvest control rules. The assessment procedures considered were: the
   eXtended Survivors Analysis (XSA), the Schaefer production model, and
   the difference model. Four HCRs were considered: first, fishing
   mortality was set on the basis of the relationship between the current
   biomass and a reference biomass; second, fishing mortality was gradually
   reduced (or increased) until it reached a required target; and the third
   and the fourth HCRs were similar to the first and second but with
   imposed TAC constraints. The stock that was generated in the operating
   model (OM) resembled the eastern Baltic cod stock. For the XSA
   assessment, two options were used: XSA with default shrinkage of
   terminal fishing mortality to the average of the estimates, and XSA with
   low shrinkage. The simulations showed that for stock assessment, the XSA
   models performed much better than the difference and Schaefer models.
   However, for the data tested, the difference and Schaefer models
   performed somewhat better in terms of management performance than the
   XSA models, especially the XSA model with default shrinkage. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) has been adopted as the primary
   management goal by several inter-government fishery organisations, and
   in the United States it forms the cornerstone of federal fishery
   management policy. MSY became a strategic goal for the management of
   Europe's fisheries following the resolution of the World Summit on
   Sustainable Development in 2002 to restore or maintain fish stocks to
   MSY levels by 2015. Calculation of MSY requires information on the rate
   at which biomass increases through growth and reproduction and the rate
   at which it decreases through natural mortality and fishing.
   Population-selection, which measures the age-specific rates of fishing
   mortality, is a key component for the calculation of yield as a function
   of fishing mortality and MSY, yet selection rarely features in either
   management advice or sensitivity analyses. Effective management of
   selection can potentially lead to increases in long-term yield, but
   before taking action managers need to understand what long-term
   increases are possible. Using a hypothetical stock, equilibrium yield
   curves were calculated for three scenarios in which the shape of the
   population-selection curve varied. The results illustrate the potential
   extent of variation in MSY and the corresponding fishing mortality
   required to achieve it (F(MSY)) that may result solely due to changes in
   population selectivity. They show that relatively subtle changes in
   selection can produce substantial differences in MSY and F(MSY). The
   results are discussed with specific reference to the development of
   long-term management targets and the mechanisms by which managers might
   try to influence population-selection. Crown Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Exploitation alters the age structure of fish stocks. Several
   stock-specific studies have suggested that changes in the age structure
   might have consequences for subsequent recruitment, but the evidence is
   not universal. To investigate how common such effects are among 39
   Northeast Atlantic fish stocks, relationships were tested between age
   structure (spawner mean age, age diversity, and proportion of recruit
   spawners) and recruitment (number of recruits, sensitivity to
   environment, and recruitment variability). Significant correlations in
   the expected direction were observed for a few stocks, but not for the
   majority; significant correlations in the opposite direction were also
   found. Meta-analyses combining the stock-level tests revealed that none
   of the effects were significant overall. However, effects were
   significant for some species (cod, haddock, and plaice) and indices. The
   low variability in the age structure might explain the absence of
   significant effects for individual stocks. Other reasons could be the
   absence of a biological basis (reproductive characteristics not
   dependent on age) or the stronger influence of environmental variability
   than of age structure on recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{Recovery plans were analysed by introducing social and economic
   behaviour and endogenous disinvestment decisions into bioeconomic
   models. Considering these endogenous constraints, a dynamic optimization
   problem was solved to find fishing mortality (F) trajectories that
   maximize discounted profits per vessel, subject to recovery of the stock
   to a spawning-stock biomass (SSB) target in 2015. The algorithm
   developed was used to assess the southern hake recovery plan. Three
   scenarios were analysed: (1) represents the current plan with an annual
   10\% reduction in F; (2) represents the optimum trajectory where profits
   must be positive all along and the SSB target is reached no later than
   2015, and (3) represents the optimum trajectory allowing profits to be
   negative. The results from (3) indicate that if economic and social
   restrictions are not considered a prior condition, the optimum solution
   implies a fleet reduction in 2010 and 2011. Comparing (1) and (2), our
   results suggest that reducing F to 0.30 by 2010 achieves the recovery
   target in 2012, increases the net present profits by 7.7\% relative to
   the current plan, and is compatible with maintaining the current fleet

   1802-1810.
   Applying single-species assessment and quotas in multispecies fisheries
   can lead to overfishing or quota underutilization, because advice can be
   conflicting when different stocks are caught within the same fishery.
   During the past decade, increased focus on this issue has resulted in
   the development of management tools based on fleets, fisheries, and
   areas, rather than on unit fish stocks. A natural consequence of this
   has been to consider effort rather than quota management, a final effort
   decision being based on fleet-harvest potential and
   fish-stock-preservation considerations. Effort allocation between fleets
   should not be based on biological considerations alone, but also on the
   economic behaviour of fishers, because fisheries management has a
   significant impact on human behaviour as well as on ecosystem
   development. The FcubEcon management framework for effort allocation
   between fleets and fisheries is presented, based on the economic
   optimization of a fishery's earnings while complying with
   stock-preservation criteria. Through case studies of two European
   fisheries, it is shown how fishery earnings can be increased
   significantly by reallocating effort between fisheries in an
   economically optimal manner, in both effort-management and single-quota
   management settings.}},

   2010. Stochastic bioeconomic modelling of alternative management
   measures for anchovy in the Mediterranean Sea. - ICES Journal of Marine
   Science, 67: 1291-1300.
   The purse-seine fishery for anchovy in the Aegean Sea consists of two
   main fleet segments (12-24 and 24-40 m vessels); this paper investigates
   economically and biologically preferable effort and capacity scenarios
   for the fishery. Attention is paid to a bioeconomic analysis of fleets
   composed of segments with varying levels of efficiency ( in terms of
   catch rate) and costs ( fixed and variable) and the role this might play
   in optimal effort allocation at a fleet level. An age-structured
   stochastic bioeconomic operating model for Aegean anchovy (Engraulis
   encrasicolus) is constructed. It attempts to account robustly for the
   multiple uncertainties in the system, including (i) the effort-fishing
   mortality relationship, (ii) the selectivity, and (iii) the
   stock-recruit dynamics of the population. A method is proposed for
   determining the economically optimal level of long-term effort in a
   fishery such as this, with similar characteristics in terms of stock
   dynamics, fishery, and markets. Lower values of effort and capacity are
   predicted to yield greater future profit when viewing the fleet in its
   entirety, but even lower values may be advisable to maintain the
   long-term biological integrity of the stock. The results may prove
   useful in balancing the productivity of the stock with the harvesting
   capacity of the fleet, while managing to ensure the long-term
   profitability of the fleet along with the sustainability of the
   resource.}},

Abstract = {{Marine protected areas (MPAs) are attaining increasing importance in the
   management of marine ecosystems. They are effective for conservation in
   tropical and subtropical areas (mainly coral and rocky reefs), but it is
   debated whether they are useful in the management of migratory fish
   stocks in open temperate regions. World War II created a large marine
   area within which commercial fishing was prevented for 6 years. Here we
   analyse scientific trawl data for three important North Sea gadoids,
   collected between 1928 and 1958. Using statistical models to summarise
   the data, we demonstrate the potential of MPAs for expediting the
   recovery of over-exploited fisheries in open temperate regions. Our
   age-structured data and population models suggest that wild fish stocks
   will respond rapidly and positively to reductions in harvesting rates
   and that the numbers of older fish in a population will react before,
   and in much greater proportion, than their younger counterparts in a
   kind of Mexican wave. Our analyses demonstrate both the overall increase
   in survival due to the lack of harvesting in the War and the form of the
   age-dependent wave in numbers. We conclude that large closed areas can
   be very useful in the conservation of migratory species from temperate
   areas and that older fish benefit fastest and in greater proportion.
   Importantly, any rise in spawning stock biomass may also not immediately
   result in better recruitment, which can respond more slowly and hence
   take longer to contribute to higher future harvestable biomass levels.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in technologies have lead to a vast influx of data on
   movements, based on discrete recorded position of animals or fishing
   boats, opening new horizons for future analyses. However, most of the
   potential interest of tracking data depends on the ability to develop
   suitable modelling strategies to analyze trajectories from discrete
   recorded positions. A serious modelling challenge is to infer the
   evolution of the true position and the associated spatio-temporal
   distribution of behavioural states using discrete, error-prone and
   incomplete observations. In this paper, a Bayesian Hierarchical Model
   (HBM) using Hidden Markov Process (HMP) is proposed as a template for
   analyzing fishing boats trajectories based on data available from
   satellite-based vessel monitoring systems (VMS). The analysis seeks to
   enhance the definition of the fishing pressure exerted on fish stocks,
   by discriminating between the different behavioural states of a fishing
   trip, and also by quantifying the relative importance of each of these
   states during a fishing trip. The HBM approach is tested to analyse the
   behaviour of pelagic trawlers in the Bay of Biscay. A hidden Markov
   chain with a regular discrete time step is used to model transitions
   between successive behavioural states (e.g., fishing, steaming, stopping
   (at Port or at sea)) of each vessel. The parameters of the movement
   process (speed and turning angles) are defined conditionally upon the
   behavioural states. Bayesian methods are used to integrate the available
   data (typically VMS position recorded at discrete time) and to draw
   inferences on any unknown parameters of the model. The model is first
   tested on simulated data with different parameters structures. Results
   provide insights on the potential of HBM with HMP to analyze VMS data.
   They show that if VMS positions are recorded synchronously with the
   instants at which the process switch from one behavioural state to
   another, the estimation method provides unbiased and precise inferences
   on behavioural states and on associated movement parameters. However, if
   the observations are not gathered with a sufficiently high frequency,
   the performance of the estimation method could be drastically impacted
   when the discrete observations are not synchronous with the switching
   instants. The model is then applied to real pathways to estimate
   variables of interest such as the number of operations per trip, time
   and distance spent fishing or travelling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Total allowable catch (TAC) management has in many fisheries, especially
   mixed fisheries, failed to meet conservation objectives. For instance,
   for the Faroe Plateau mixed demersal fisheries, the TAC system failed to
   achieve the objective of an average annual fishing mortality of 0.45 for
   the three gadoid stocks cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus
   aeglefinus), and saithe (Pollachius virens). Therefore, in 1996, an
   effort-regulation system with individual transferable effort quotas was
   introduced to manage the fisheries. Experience has shown that effort
   management without additional stock-specific measures may not be
   appropriate for such fisheries. A management strategy evaluation model
   was developed to compare an effort-management system based on the
   Faroese example with a TAC system as currently applied in EU fisheries.
   Results show that when stocks are considered in isolation, a total
   allowable effort system does not necessarily perform better than a TAC
   one. It depends on stock status and dynamics, the level of uncertainty,
   and the reactivity of the system to changes in scientific advice. When
   the stocks are considered together in mixed fisheries, effort management
   seems, however, to be appropriate, and interannual flexibility of the
   system appears to be the best compromise between short- and long-term
   objectives, as well as between biological sustainability and economic
   return.}},

Abstract = {{Spatio-seasonal explicit simulation models can predict the impact of
   spatial management measures on marine fish populations and fishing
   activities. As fisheries are complex systems, fisheries simulation
   models are often complex, with many uncertain parameters. Here, the
   methodology is provided to deliver fishery diagnostics within an
   uncertainty context using a complex simulation tool. A sensitivity
   analysis of the model is performed on model outputs using partial
   least-squares to identify the most sensitive parameters. The impact of
   several management measures is then simulated using a statistical
   simulation design taking into account the uncertainty of the selected
   sensitive parameters. This approach was applied to the Bay of Biscay
   anchovy stock using the ISIS-Fish (Integration of Spatial Information
   for Simulation of Fisheries) model to assess the impact of imposing
   marine protected areas (MPAs) conditionally on parameter uncertainty.
   The diagnostic appeared to be highly sensitive to the mortality of
   larvae and juveniles, growth, and reproduction. The uncertainty of the
   values of these parameters did not permit any of the simulated MPA
   designs to be proposed. However, according to anchovy catch and biomass,
   the simulations allowed the low impact of closure duration to be shown
   and underscored the utility of protecting such key processes as

Abstract = {{Fisheries management is conducted to achieve sustainable use of fishery
   resources, mainly through regulation of fishing activities. For almost a
   decade, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna
   (CCSBT) struggled to reach agreement on a total allowable catch (TAC)
   for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) because of stock assessment
   uncertainties. To address this, in 2002 the CCSBT commenced development
   of a management procedure (MP), a pre-agreed set of rules to determine
   how the TAC will be adjusted as new monitoring data become available.
   The CCSBT Scientific Committee tested various candidate MPs using
   operating models which simulate fish population and fishery dynamics as
   well as incorporate process, observation, and model uncertainties.
   Candidate MPs were evaluated using performance measures related to the
   following management objectives: maximize catches, avoid stock collapse,
   and minimize interannual catch variation. Of the MPs explored, some
   relied solely on empirical data {[}i.e., adjusted TAC based on catch per
   unit effort (CPUE) trends], whereas others were more complicated, based
   on population models. In 2005, the CCSBT adopted a model-based MP that
   realized a moderate catch with low variability and avoided stock
   collapse. This MP struck a compromise between the risk-prone and
   risk-averse standpoints of the different stakeholders. However, despite
   this concerted scientific effort, the MP was not implemented because,
   shortly after its adoption, it became evident that historical catches
   may have been substantially underreported. This complication
   necessitates returning to near the beginning of the development process.
   MP approaches have various advantages and challenges to be explored
   further. However, it is essential to lessen human-introduced uncertainty
   (such as catch misreporting) by enhanced enforcement, and to increase
   management robustness to biological uncertainties by implementing MPs.}},

Abstract = {{Winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) of all length classes increased
   dramatically in abundance on Georges Bank in the 1980s following the
   decline of many groundfish species. We present a full population model
   of winter skate to better understand the population dynamics of the
   species and elucidate the mechanisms underlying their increase in
   abundance in the 1980s. Specifically, we developed four statistical
   catch-at-age models incorporating length-frequency data with the
   following model structures: (i) observation error only (base model R1);
   (ii) observation and recruitment process errors (model R2); (iii) adult
   migration modeled as a random walk in adult mortality (model R3); and
   (iv) observation and recruitment process errors and adult migration
   (model R4). Akaike's information criterion values indicated that models
   R3 and R4, which both included adult migration, were the most
   parsimonious models. This finding strongly suggests that the winter
   skate population increase on Georges Bank in the 1980s was not solely a
   result of increases in recruitment but likely involved adult migration
   (i. e., it is an open population). Finally, recent predicted fishing
   mortalities exceeded FMSY for all models.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to investigate the robustness of
   the management procedure (MP) of Northern European hake to alternative
   indices of reproductive potential (RP) based on our recently improved
   understanding of hake reproductive biology using a Management Strategy
   Evaluation (MSE) framework. MSE simulations allow the testing of the
   robustness of conventional management systems to uncertainties or
   different hypothesis about underlying population dynamics. For this
   purpose, four different reproductive potential (RP) indices of
   increasing biological complexity (i.e. Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB)
   using constant maturity: SSB(MAT) adding variation on maturity, Female
   Spawning Biomass-FSB, and Total Egg Production-TEP) were estimated and
   tested. The inclusion of more biological information affected the
   perception of the population dynamics, the biological reference points
   (BRPs) as well as the perception of the stock in relation to those
   biological reference points. In this study, the probability of a wrong
   perception, i.e. the ``perceived{''} population is above reference
   limits while the ``true{''} population is overfished, was 13, 5, 3 and
   3\% for the different RP investigated in the time period between 1978
   and 2008. This probability was around 0\% in all cases studied for the
   projected period of 2009-2040. Our results show that (i) when including
   more information about reproductive biology in the simulation, the
   number of years below the BRPs are higher in the ``perceived{''}
   population than in the ``true{''} population, (ii) for the historic
   period the probability of a wrong perception is diminished when
   alternative reproductive indices are included when simulating both,
   `true' and `perceived' populations, and (iii) during the initial years
   of the projected period, although the perception of the population
   dynamics in relation to BRP is different between SSB(WG) scenario and
   alternative RP indices, the outcomes of the management advice of the
   SSB(WG) are more restrictive because the wrong perception is
   conservative, i.e. when ``true{''} population is above B(pa) the SSB(WG)
   is below. Thus, it can be concluded that the MP for European hake is
   robust to the different hypothesis about alternative RP indices.
   However, the results of the present study also showed that for the
   historic period, when the population level was close to BRP level, the
   perception of the stocks status differs between alternative RP indices.
   Thus, it would be convenient to include the reproductive biology of the
   species in the Harvest Control Rules (HCR) and Long Term Management Plan
   (LTMP) of this stock, especially when the level of the stock is close to
   BRP level. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rochet and Rice, while recognizing management strategy evaluation (MSE)
   as an important step forward in fisheries management, level a number of
   criticisms at its implementation. Some of their points are sound, such
   as the need for care in representing uncertainties and for thorough
   documentation of the process. However, others evidence important
   misunderstandings. Although the difficulties in estimating tail
   probabilities and risks, as discussed by Rochet and Rice, are well
   known, their arguments that Efron's nonparametric bootstrap re-sampling
   method underestimates the probabilities of low values are flawed. In any
   case, though, the focus of MSEs is primarily on comparing performance
   and robustness across alternative management procedures (MPs), rather
   than on estimating absolute levels of risk. Qualitative methods can
   augment MSE, but their limitations also need to be recognized.
   Intelligence certainly needs to play a role in fisheries management, but
   not at the level of tinkering in the provision of annual advice, which
   Rochet and Rice apparently advocate, inter alia because this runs the
   risk of advice following noise rather than signal. Instead, intelligence
   should come into play in the exercise of oversight through the process
   of multiannual reviews of MSE and associated MPs. A number of examples
   are given of the process of interaction with stakeholders which should
   characterize MSE.}},

Abstract = {{Iberian hake assessment revealed an increase in. shing mortality (F)
   despite enforcement of a recovery plan. Recent landings exceeded the

   management strategies based on F control were evaluated with respect to
   the probability of recovering spawning-stock biomass (SSB), expected
   profits, and robustness to uncertainty on catch information and stock
   dynamics. Results showed that the use of censored catch data, i.e.
   excluding the Gulf of Cadiz or discards, may lead to inappropriate
   conclusions. Reducing. shing mortality was necessary for SSB to recover.
   An F(max) strategy with discard reduction showed the highest probability
   of rebuilding SSB and led the fishery to sustainable exploitation, with
   an expected \%SPR of 30-40\% in 2025, mean individual weight in the
   landings of 450 g in 2015, and yield increasing by >20\%. Because of
   uncertainty in the estimates of maximum sustainable yield, management
   strategies based on FMSY were least robust, but all strategies were

Abstract = {{Many fisheries are managed by total allowable catches (TACs) and a
   substantial part by individual quotas. Such output management has not
   been successful in mixed fisheries when fishers continue to fish while
   discarding marketable fish. We analyse the effects of individual quotas
   on spatial and temporal effort allocation and over-quota discarding in a
   multispecies fishery. Using a spatially explicit dynamic-state variable
   model, the optimal fishing strategy of fishers constrained by annual
   individual quotas, facing uncertainty in catch rates, is studied.
   Individual fishers will move away from areas with high catches of the
   restricted quota species and, depending on the cost of fishing, will
   stop fishing in certain periods of the year. Individual vessels will
   discard marketable fish, but only after their individual quota for the
   species under consideration has been reached. These results are in line
   with observations on effort allocation and discarding of marketable
   fish, both over-quota discarding and highgrading, by the Dutch
   beam-trawl fleet. The models we present can be used to predict the
   outcomes of management and are therefore a useful tool for fisheries
   scientists and managers.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the EU 2008 multi-annual plan for Baltic cod stock
   recovery. The plan combines harvest control rules that set TACs with
   reductions in direct effort (E) and fishing mortality (F). Performance
   and robustness of the plan are tested with a management strategy
   evaluation model (MSE). Stochastic simulations are carried out under
   different scenarios of recruitment and sources of uncertainties. Under
   the different magnitudes of errors investigated, the plan in its current
   design is likely to reach precautionary targets for the Eastern and the
   Western Baltic cod stocks by 2015. It is, however, more sensitive to
   implementation errors (e.g. catch misreporting) than to observation
   errors (e.g. data collection) when the (i) current settings of the ICES
   single-stock assessment model are maintained. (ii) intended fishing
   effort reduction is fully complied with, and (iii) biological parameters
   are assumed constant. For the Eastern Baltic stock, additional sources
   of uncertainties from fishery adaptation to the plan are tested using a
   fleet-based and spatially explicit version of the model which leads to
   higher reductions in F and no significant change in management
   robustness. The relative difference between both approaches is mainly
   due to differences in exploitation patterns in catching the same amount
   of fish. The effort control is demonstrated to be more efficient when
   supplemented with a TAC and avoids un-intended effects from fishery
   responses, e.g. spatial effort reallocation. Medium term economic
   evaluation of fishery performance shows an initial reduction in profit
   with effort and TAC reductions, but profit is always positive. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The design and evaluation of survey-based management strategies is
   addressed in this article, using three case-study fisheries: North Sea
   herring, Bay of Biscay anchovy and North Sea cod, with a brief history
   and the main management issues with each fishery outlined. A range of
   operational management procedures for the case study stocks were
   designed and evaluated using trends that may be derived from survey
   indices (spawner biomass, year-class strength and total mortality) with
   an array of simple and more structured observation error regimes
   simulated. Model-free and model-based indicators of stock status were
   employed in the management procedures. On the basis of stochastic
   stock-specific simulations, we identified the following key determinants
   of successful management procedures: (i) adequate specification of the
   stock-recruit relationship (model structure, parameter estimates and
   variability), (ii) knowledge of the magnitude and structure of the
   variation in the survey indices, and (iii) explication of the particular
   management objectives, when assessing management performance. More
   conservative harvesting strategies are required to meet specified
   targets in the presence of increasing stochasticity, due to both process
   and observation error. It was seen that survey-based operational
   management procedures can perform well in the absence of commercial
   data, and can also inform aspects of survey design with respect to
   acceptable levels of error or bias in the surveys.}},

Abstract = {{The current CCAMLR assessment method for mackerel icefish
   (Champsocephalus gunnari) in Subarea 48.3 employs the CCAMLR mixture
   analysis program (CMIX) and generalised yield model (GYM) packages,
   which derives population numbers-at-age and projects these numbers
   forward under the given harvest control rule to set a two-year total
   allowable catch (TAC). One issue is the accurate identification of age
   cohorts from the survey data. In this paper a length-based approach is
   described that removes the problem of cohort determination. A bootstrap
   technique (consistent with the current CCAMLR approach) is used to
   estimate the length distribution of the population from the survey data
   which, in conjunction with the bootstrapped survey biomass data, yields
   an estimate of the population numbers-at-length. A comparison of this
   method and the existing age-based CMIX/GYM methodology showed very good
   agreement in calculated yields for 2006, 2007 and 2009, and some
   differences for 2008 which were explained by an unusual length
   distribution from which it was difficult to reliably estimate age
   composition in CMIX. Using the 2009 survey data and the new methodology,
   a TAC was calculated according to the CCAMLR decision rules of 1 577 and
   933 tonnes for the 2009/10 and 2010/11 fishing seasons respectively. The
   respective estimates using the existing CMIX/GYM methodology were 1 590
   and 968 tonnes respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The fishery for Patagonian toothfish around the island of South Georgia
   in the Southern Ocean is a profitable operation targeting a high-value,

   model currently used for assessments with a Schaefer production model,
   which performs equally well as an operating model for management
   strategy evaluation. Our analysis demonstrated that optimum long-term
   profitability using a discount rate of 2\% would be achieved at a
   biomass of 59\% of initial biomass, which is higher than the target
   biomass of 50\% incorporated into the current management strategy and at
   a reduction in effort of approximately 19\%. A number of potential
   effort reduction strategies are investigated, several of which would
   achieve better conservation objectives and higher future profits from
   the fishery than those predicted using the current management strategy.}},

   the British isles, where stocks are currently assessed and managed by
   management area, although there is evidence of mixing between stocks (in
   terms of connectivity, migrations, and exploitation). The simulations
   evaluate scientific advice (based on virtual population analysis, VPA)
   and the sustainability of fishing under two population-structure
   scenarios, corresponding either to discrete stocks, which only mix on
   the feeding grounds, or where diffusion between stocks takes place. The
   ability of stock assessment to monitor stock status and exploitation
   levels was evaluated for defining stocks based on fishing areas and for
   stocks that combined fishing areas. The study showed that assessment
   based on VPA of the metapopulation could fail to detect overexploitation
   of stocks and fail to detect and distinguish between the effects of
   exploitation and regime shifts.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{950-959}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Uncertainty affects the behaviour of fishers and fisheries regulators in
   a way that can adversely affect the sustainability of fish stocks,
   fisheries income, and productivity. In agriculture, there has been a
   long history of using levy funds and public and private insurance
   schemes to mediate economic risks to growers resulting from
   environmental variability and quarantine risks. In the United States,
   the federal government continues to underwrite funds (collected by
   contracted private agents) that are used to protect contributors from
   the effects of extreme weather and pest and disease losses. In Europe,
   there are examples of industry-based mutual funds to mediate risks from
   exotic agricultural diseases. In agriculture, insurance mechanisms have
   been successful in reducing risk-inducing behaviour by contractual
   compliance to risk-reducing codes of practice. For fisheries, insurance
   may provide a tool to address some elements of uncertainty in a way that
   would help both the fishing industry and the regulators achieve
   objectives of sustainability, income security, and productivity. This
   paper presents a brief review of insurance in agriculture and capture
   fisheries and uses a stochastic model to illustrate how insurance funds
   could protect revenue and encourage increased sustainability of
   fisheries and improve compliance with and enforcement of fisheries
   regulation. Although insurance may be a partial solution to
   unsatisfactory fisheries management and fishing performance, some
   potential challenges to this novel approach are also discussed.}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{233-241}},

Abstract = {{ALADYM (age-length based dynamic model) is an age-length based
   simulation model designed to predict the consequences of management
   scenarios on a single population, in terms of different metrics and
   indicators. Removals are simulated as total mortality modulated using a
   selectivity pattern and a fishing activity coefficient. ALADYM uses the
   classical equations of population dynamics to create a tool that uses
   fishery-independent information (e. g. from trawl surveys) as the
   primary source. The formulation of population dynamics at a small time
   scale (month) allows to model the effects of harvest controls that
   evolve through the year, which is particularly useful for fast growing
   species. The possibility of specifying a vector of natural mortality by
   age/length makes the model more suitable for situations where stocks are
   exploited at an early life stage, as in many Mediterranean fisheries,
   while introducing variations along the time of the harvesting pattern
   accounts for non-equilibrium situations. Stochastic effects can be added
   to some key life-history traits to incorporate uncertainty in input
   parameters and in their relationships. ALADYM can be used for a range of
   applications such as comparing management strategies, evaluating
   indicator changes or searching for reference points.}},

Abstract = {{Ideas and considerations are put forward for managing fisheries and
   marine populations using primarily trawl surveys to supply biological
   and spatial indicators of the state of stocks, and to permit catch per
   unit effort (CPUE)-based assessments. Trawl surveys seldom allow
   absolute estimates of fish population sizes but, if appropriately
   located, timed, and designed, can provide a broad range of information
   about catchable fish species and the ecosystem that supports them. This
   information may be more conducive to sustainable management of fisheries
   than the traditional focus on the abundances of selected stocks. The
   paper first briefly proposes how survey-based methods might supplement
   existing fishery-dependent stock assessments, as would be necessary
   during a transition phase to a more ecosystem-orientated system of
   management. Full survey-based management is then considered in relation
   to management objectives, the selection of indicators, survey design,
   reference periods, levels and directions, statistical aspects,
   CPUE-based assessments, and management responses to good and bad signals
   from the ecosystem. We argue that existing fishery-dependent stock
   assessments cannot be claimed to produce absolute estimates of stock
   abundance and fishing mortality because natural mortality (M) is seldom
   known accurately and, therefore, that they should not be presumed
   superior to the relative information from surveys, and an agreeable form
   of adaptive management.}},

Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{The biological and economic implications of different management
   measures concerning the Mediterranean swordfish stock were evaluated by
   means of simulations performed under the Fisheries Language in R(FLR)
   framework. Six different scenarios were examined including
   Mediterranean-wide seasonal closures of different duration and an effort
   reduction scheme. Recruitment was assumed to vary in levels either
   predicted by a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship or around an
   average value estimated from the latest assessment accomplished by the
   International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).
   Simulations projected the levels of landings, spawning stock biomass
   (SSB), gross and net revenue for a period of twenty years. Considering
   the estimated statistical uncertainty, gains in terms of landings and
   SSB from short fishery closures (e.g. one month) will be negligible. On
   the contrary, seasonal closures of at least four months would result in
   important long-term gains, which are more profound in the case of SSB
   and net revenue. The ICCAT convention objectives concerning SSB. can
   only be met with drastic closures (i.e. six months). However, drastic
   closures would result in short-term decreases in landings and revenues,
   which should be taken into account before such measures are adopted. (C)

   been an unprecedented 6 sequential years of poor juvenile production
   (recruitment). Analysis suggests that the poor recruitment arises during
   the larval overwintering phase, with recent survival rates greatly
   reduced. Contemporary warming of the North Sea has caused significant
   changes in the plankton community, and a recently identified regime
   shift around 2000 shows close temporal agreement with the reduced larval
   survival. It is, therefore, possible that we are observing the first
   consequences of this planktonic change for higher trophic levels. There
   is no indication of a recovery in recruitment in the short term. Fishing
   mortality is currently outside the agreed management plan, and forecasts
   show a high risk of the stock moving outside safe biological limits
   soon, potentially precipitating another collapse of the stock. However,
   bringing the realized fishing mortality back in line with the management
   plan would likely alleviate the problem. This illustrates again that
   recruitment is influenced by more than just spawning-stock biomass, and
   that changes in other factors can be of equal, or even greater,
   importance. In such dynamically changing environments, recent management
   success does not necessarily guarantee future sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for the initial stock assessment and adaption of catch
   limits and tagging rates is presented for new and exploratory stocks in
   the CAMLR Convention Area. The assessment methodology is designed to be
   able to accommodate mark-recapture data, catch (legal and illegal,
   unreported and unregulated (IUU)) and relative abundance data into an
   integrated assessment framework when more detailed data are not
   available - namely catch-at-length/age data and tagging data
   at-length/age. A simple algorithm, based upon the Petersen abundance
   estimator, is defined whereby catch limits and tagging rates can be
   adjusted together to define tagging levels that will produce an expected
   abundance estimate in the following year of a given precision whilst
   ensuring the sustainable exploitation of the stock as per the CCAMLR
   management procedure. The combination of the assessment and tagging rate
   adaption methods can then form the basis of an early management plan for
   exploratory fisheries. The accuracy of the catch limit and tag-rate
   adaption algorithm is tested using the assessment results for toothfish
   in CCAMLR Subarea 48.3 and the assessment method is applied to the catch
   (legal and IUU) and mark-recapture data for Patagonian toothfish
   (Dissostichus eleginoides) in Division 58.4.3a with catch limit and
   tag-rate recommendations being made given the assessment results and
   using the catch limit/tag-rate adaption algorithm.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{88-97}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The recovery of a stock after severe exploitation is of major interest
   to fish ecologists and managers alike. Understanding the dynamics of
   recruitment at low stock sizes is crucial to the simulation of stocks as
   they recover. Compensation in recruitment has occurred in North Sea
   herring, and it was stronger after the collapse of the stock. The
   compensation appears to be a product of both increased production of
   larvae per spawner and increased survival to the juvenile stage. There
   is only slight evidence for depensation and the point at which North Sea
   herring has zero recruitment appears close to the origin. There is more
   variability in recruits per unit spawning stock size when the stock is
   smaller, this is probably as a result of the potential larger diversity
   in contributions from spawning components in an unexploited stock
   compared to an overexploited stock. Mimicking this dynamic in population
   models will increase the uncertainties in a projection of stock
   recovery. The lack of observations at higher stock sizes hinders our
   ability to compare the dynamics of recruit to SSB across the full range
   of stock sizes, however, recent apparent over-compensation at higher
   spawning biomass has resulted in less than one recruit per mature adult
   being produced per year. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A paradigm shift in oceans management is underway, which will influence
   the future of stock assessment. On one hand, fisheries are increasingly
   being seen as one ocean sector amongst many, with many new objectives
   under an ecosystem approach to management (EAM) being sought. On the
   other hand, there is in-owing acceptance that stock assessment needs to
   be considered as only one element of a more comprehensive management
   strategy evaluation (MSE). Both these trends have implications for
   science Support of future MSEs and file process whereby this science is
   managed and delivered. There will be a move towards ecosystem models
   that propose plausible hypotheses of ecosystem functioning. To support
   these, there will need to he theoretical developments on ecosystem
   control, spatial dynamics, and the habitat - productivity linkage.
   Growth in monitoring technology will provide unprecedented opportunities
   to enhance Our knowledge and will fundamentally impact MSE and EAM.
   Stock assessment will initially be similar to current versions but will
   increasingly be required to report on ecosystem-related impacts.
   Decision making will involve evaluation of the merits of competing
   management strategies in relation to achievement of EAM objectives in
   the face of uncertainty. The science delivery process will evolve
   towards review and agreement of management frameworks separate from
   their scheduled application in assessment. Framework reviews will become
   quite elaborate, having to deal with all elements of an MSE. Experience
   with MSE has been limited but positive thus far with experiments in the
   approach occurring globally. The transition to the new paradigm will
   however require both a Cultural shift in the scientific, Ocean
   management and stakeholder communities and new financial mechanisms.
   Notwithstanding this, the new paradigm promises to provide a more
   effective basis for the management of the world's oceans resources.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between fisheries management and fisheries science has
   become more complex and more challenging over recent years as we move
   from a fish stock-focused approach to the management of fisheries with
   the ob objective of maximum sustainable yield, to an approach with
   Multiple objectives encompassing the precautionary approach,
   ecosystem-based management, and industry economic viability. At its
   core, the precautionary approach is about taking more cautious measures
   in the face of uncertainty. Linked to this is the growing recognition of
   the need to take oil ecosystem approach to fisheries management. file
   increasing lack of stability in ocean conditions and uncertainty around
   the effect g ocean conditions has enhanced the need to be more
   comprehensive in of our approach. All this serves to make fisheries
   management More complex than it was in the past. Whereas fisheries
   science advice in the past was focused largely on stock biomass and
   productivity, fisheries science is now being asked to provide advice,
   information, and analysis oil stock interactions and predation, oil
   spawning seasons and locations, oil sensitive areas of significance to
   the species, oil the effect of Various gear technologies on benthic
   communities, oil the effect of the increasing number of invasive species
   in the ecosystem, and oil changing ocean conditions and their potential
   effect on stock dynamics now and in the future. With Static funding
   resources over the past decade, scientists have struggled to find ways
   to respond to these new queries and to still provide basic stock status
   advice that continues to be and will continue to be the core scientific
   requirement for making , fisheries management decisions. This state of
   affairs has stretched the capacity of fisheries science to respond to
   the growing array of information requests that are now considered
   necessary to make responsible decisions. Indeed, the growing complexity
   and challenges for fisheries management, for fisheries science and for
   the fishing industry as a whole, has significantly stretched static
   resources but has been addressed by unique responses, depending on the
   circumstances, and the development of new partnerships and working
   arrangements between fisheries managers, scientists, and the fishing
   industry.}},

Abstract = {{The scope of this paper is to describe, evaluate, and forecast fishing
   trip choices of the Bay of Biscay pelagic fleet using random utility
   modeling (RUM). First, alternative fishing trip choices of this fleet
   were identified using multivariate statistical methods based on species
   landings weighted by value and defined as distinct fishing activity or
   fisheries (termed metiers). A RUM was specified, which included trip
   components as attributes during the period 20012004 ( a lagged
   percentage of the value per unit of effort of the main species caught,
   total value per unit of effort, and inertia in terms of changes from one
   metier to another). For the main metiers, the proportion of correct
   effort allocation is 90\% during the calibration period of 2001-2004.
   The results from the RUM are used to parameterize a simulation model of
   trip choice. The model is used to predict trip choices in 2005,
   throughout most of which fishing was constrained by the closure of the
   European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) fishery. Simulation results
   are compared with observed trip choices following the fishing ban: 80\%
   of observed trip choices are correctly predicted by the model. The
   capacity of the behavioral model to predict responses to the closure is
   then discussed.}},

Abstract = {{North Sea haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) are managed under a plan
   agreed between the European Union (EU) and Norway. This management plan
   was reviewed during 2006. As part of the review process, a quantitative
   management strategy evaluation (MSE) was undertaken, both of the
   existing plan and of proposed modifications. The evaluation was
   implemented in the R programming system, using FLR libraries, and was
   based on stochastic simulations of the complete fishery system
   (including a biological operating model, a knowledge production model
   with ``live{''} stock assessments, and a simple implementation model).
   The generation of appropriate time-series of recruitment was of key
   importance for a stock like North Sea haddock which produces sporadic
   large year-classes. Although some refinement of growth and discard
   models is still required, tentative conclusions can be reached on the
   likely efficacy of different management plans. Well-defined MSEs have
   the potential to impart useful information for assessment scientists,
   fisheries managers and stakeholders. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published

Abstract = {{Currently, several European fishing fleets are regulated through a
   combination of harvest and effort control. The two regulation schemes
   are interrelated, i.e. a given quota limit will necessarily determine
   the effort used, and vice versa. It is important to acknowledge this
   causality when assessing combined effort and harvest regulation systems.
   A bioeconomic feedback model is presented that takes into account the
   causality between effort and harvest control by switching back and forth
   between the two, depending on which is the binding rule. The model
   consists of a biological and an economic operation module, the former
   simulating stock assessment and quota establishment, and the latter
   simulating the economic fleet dynamics. When harvest control is binding,
   catch is evaluated using the biological projection formula, whereas the
   economics-based Cobb-Douglas production function is used when effort is
   binding. The method is applied to the Dutch beam trawl fishery for
   plaice and sole in the North Sea.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the biological and economic impact of changing from
   management based on single-species limit reference points to one based
   on alternative targets, using the multispecies multifleet North Sea
   flatfish fishery. The robustness of reference points was tested against
   identified changes in plaice and sole biology. Current ICES
   single-species limit and precautionary biomass and fishing mortality
   reference points were seldom consistent with each other. Although they
   were generally robust to biological uncertainty, fishing at F(pa) for
   sole could lead to stock collapse under one biological scenario.
   Adoption of alternative targets would reduce reliance on current
   reference points as stocks moved to a more sustainable state. Maximum
   sustainable yield (MSY), maximum economic yield (MEY), and maximum
   employment conditions implied different effort levels in the two fleets
   modelled, and different profits. F(target) could be achieved with equal
   effort reductions in both fleets. Changes in stock biology affected the
   fishing effort required to maximize employment within the fishery,
   whereas MSY, F(max), and MEY targets were robust to this uncertainty.
   Resulting profits and yields did vary widely, however. The selection of
   target reference points therefore requires stakeholders to define
   fishery objectives explicitly, against which targets can be evaluated
   for the resulting trade-offs between risk to stocks, yield, employment,
   and other social objectives.}},

Abstract = {{1. Fishing spans all oceans and the impact on ocean predators such as
   sharks and rays is largely unknown. A lack of data and complicated
   jurisdictional issues present particular challenges for assessing and
   conserving high seas biodiversity. It is clear, however, that pelagic
   sharks and rays of the open ocean are subject to high and often
   unrestricted levels of mortality from bycatch and targeted fisheries for
   their meat and valuable fins.
   2. These species exhibit a wide range of life-history characteristics,
   but many have relatively low productivity and consequently relatively
   high intrinsic vulnerability to over-exploitation. The IUCN-World
   Conservation Union Red List criteria were used to assess the global
   status of 21 oceanic pelagic shark and ray species.
   3. Three-quarters (16) of these species are classified as Threatened or
   Near Threatened. Eleven species are globally threatened with higher risk
   of extinction: the giant devilray is Endangered, ten sharks are
   Vulnerable and a further five species are Near Threatened. Threat status
   depends on the interaction between the demographic resilience of the
   species and intensity of fisheries exploitation.
   4. Most threatened species, like the shortfin mako shark, have low
   population increase rates and suffer high fishing mortality throughout
   their range. Species with a lower risk of extinction have either fast,
   resilient life histories (e.g. pelagic stingray) or are species with
   slow, less resilient life histories but subject to fisheries management
   (e.g. salmon shark).
   5. Recommendations, including implementing and enforcing firming bans
   and catch limits, are made to guide effective conservation and
   management of these sharks and rays. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Alternative management scenarios were evaluated in a simulation
   framework that mimicked the recent exploitation of sole and plaice in
   the North Sea. A large proportion of plaice is taken as bycatch of the
   beam trawl fleet targeting sole, yet current management of the two
   stocks assumes no interaction in their exploitation. The evaluation
   criteria included biological and economic sustainability, and stability
   in the management measures. The fishery was assumed to respond to
   management restrictions by dropping the least profitable trips. We
   investigated two contrasting management strategies, single-species total
   allowable catches, and effort regulation. Under the assumptions made,
   the latter strategy performed better. The results suggest that, given
   assessment error and bias, a strategy that accounts for the mixed nature
   of a fishery and that occasionally results in perceived
   underexploitation may work best. Stability in fishing mortality
   reinforces itself, through lower assessment bias, and management
   corrections become less frequent. The common assumption in many stock
   assessments in EC waters that fishing mortality in the most recent year
   should resemble the value obtained in previous years ({''}shrinkage{''})

Abstract = {{Marine turtles have been exploited by humans since pre-history, with
   particular intensity in the last century, the result of which has been
   the depletion of most nesting populations in the world. In many cases
   these declines have been reversed thanks to a variety of effective
   conservation programs. Several nesting populations maintain positive
   growth trends, although most are probably depleted relative to historic
   levels, while others continue in a severely depleted state, with little
   or no population growth in recent decades. This mosaic of population
   trajectories along with demographic and life-history traits that buffer
   against extinction has created unique challenges for marine turtle
   assessments such as those by the World Conservation Union's (IUCN)
   Marine Turtle Specialist Group, which conducts global assessments for
   the IUCN Red List. While the Red Listing approach describes extinction
   risk, which theoretically can be useful for developing conservation
   priorities, the descriptors that have been assigned to marine turtles so
   far (e.g. Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered) state an
   unrealistic imminence of extinction, a problem enhanced by the fact that
   its global resolution fails to reflect the disparate population trends
   ongoing in different regions worldwide. Coupled with misuse of the Red
   List by governments and conservation organizations worldwide, these
   shortcomings have led to increased debate regarding its efficacy for
   marine turtles. In this paper we describe the Red Listing assessment
   process, the problems associated with this approach for marine turtles,
   as well as the overall value of Red List assessments for marine turtle
   conservation. We suggest that Red list assessments for marine turtles at
   the global scale do not accurately depict the current status of marine
   turtles and may have unintended consequences for their conservation.
   Largely the data do not exist, or are not reliable, making the use of
   the current criteria intractable. We discuss novel methods for
   conducting marine turtle assessments, such as using a wider array of the
   current Red List Criteria, modelling future population dynamics, and
   developing regional assessments and/or conservation prescriptive
   assessments. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   meet their goals is widely recognized, it is almost impossible to
   achieve this by conducting large-scale experiments on fish populations.
   There has therefore been a trend towards the use of computer simulation
   to identify management strategies that can satisfy multiple objectives
   and that are robust to uncertainty. This chapter introduces harvest
   control rules (HCRs), and reviews the use of the Management Strategy
   Evaluation (MSE) framework, including its role in the transformation of
   HCRs into management procedures. Several examples of the implementation
   and use of the MSE framework around the world are given, and potential
   benefits and problems are discussed. Finally, the paper discusses the
   possible role of the MSE framework in implementing agreements under the
   World Summit on Sustainable Development and ecosystem-based fisheries
   management.}},

   collect, analyse and use information about fish stocks, the natural
   systems of which they are part, and the external conditions that affect
   them. It is often claimed that this knowledge would contribute to the
   sustainable use of marine resources if taken into account in the
   development of fisheries management plans. However, the incorporation of
   new knowledge in such processes has been slow compared with the rate at
   which new knowledge is accumulated. Here, we discuss some of the factors
   that can impede the uptake of new knowledge at both the level of
   preparing official scientific advice or when this advice is used to
   adopt fishery management measures. We also suggest ways to improve
   utilization and uptake of new knowledge and reference cases in which

Abstract = {{Over the past 80 years there have been many advances in the development
   of multispecies fisheries models, from the simple predator-prey models
   of Vito Volterra to the highly complex ecosystem and size-based models
   of today. Here, we explore whether multispecies fisheries models have
   provided useful insight or whether they have been guilty of ``muddying
   the waters{''}. We conclude that multispecies models have proved useful,
   in particular they have shown that natural predators may take of the
   same order of prey fish as fishing vessels, they have provided
   information on the long-term prognosis for stock recovery, and they have
   been used to evaluate precautionary reference points for fishery
   management. However, the course of history has not always run smoothly,
   and scientists have found it difficult to describe adequately the
   functional relationships that exist between predators and their prey.
   Added to this, there are infinite ways to configure complex foodweb
   models, so it is often very difficult to discern the main influences on
   model outputs. Several promising avenues for future research are
   described, including individual- and size-based models, stochastic
   multispecies models, and coupled biogeochemical and fisheries models.
   One of the most promising avenues might be to provide operating models
   for inclusion in operational management procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The biology and fisheries of macrourid species in the NE Atlantic are
   reviewed. Of about 30 species that occur within that area, the roundnose
   grenadier Coryphaenoides rupestris is one of the main target species of
   deep-water fisheries. Roughhead grenadier Macrourus berglax is a minor
   bycatch of other deep-water fisheries and an occasional target of sonic
   small fisheries. Other macrourid species are not commercially exploited
   because they are too small and/or in too deep waters, but sonic are also
   taken as accidental bycatch. There are three main fisheries for
   roundnose grenadier: north and west of the British Isles, Skagerrak, and
   Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Skagerrak fishery is mainly for fish meal while
   the others are for human consumption. Due to data availability, a range
   of assessment methods has been trialled primarily for stocks to the
   north and west of the British Isles. Although uncertain, these
   assessments provide evidence that the stock has been severely depleted.
   Fisheries were largely unregulated until the early 2000s, but following
   repeated International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)
   advice, total allowable catches were introduced in 2003 together with
   effort and capacity regulations. Roundnose grenadier is the most studied
   species. It lives more than 50 years, compared to 30 years or more for
   roughhead grenadier. The limited knowledge of other species suggests a
   contrasting picture of maximum age ranging from 10 to 40 years. Taking
   into account the limited biological knowledge for these species, the
   pros and cons of the current management regime are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was studied at the Bar Haven, Placentia Bay,
   Newfoundland (NAFO 3Ps stock unit) spawning ground from 1996 to 2003.
   Lessons applicable to management of rebuilding stocks derived from these
   studies are reviewed: (1) cod spawn in the same area each year, but
   numbers and timing vary (spawning biomass varied from 2,000 to 25,000 t,
   with timing protracted over at least 100 days); (2) courtship and
   spawning behavior is complex, and includes lekking, sound production,
   and vertical rituals; (3) large fish in good condition are necessary to
   large egg potential because fecundity increases exponentially with fish
   size-total egg potential varied considerably from year to year with
   spawning abundance, age changes, and mean liver condition in spawning
   females; (4) retention of early life stages did not explain local
   recruitment and rankings of annual densities of eggs, larvae and
   juveniles did not match with local recruitment during three years of
   study; (5) dispersal of early life stages, juveniles, and adults was
   density-dependent; (6) individual adults homed to the same spawning
   ground in sequential years, but others strayed; (7) egg potential was
   correlated with the return of adults to the spawning ground 4-5 years
   later (r(2) = 0.33, d.f. 3), and with recruitment to the full stock area
   (NAFO subdivision 3Ps) (r(2) = 0.96, d.f. 5), with only weak
   compensation in survival at low stock size; (8) fishing on spawning
   aggregations may harm reproductive potential; and (9) seasonal fisheries
   influence fishing mortality, commercial yield, and value. Management
   implications are discussed.}},

Journal = {{FISHERIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2-3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Within commercial fisheries, particularly mixed fisheries, both target
   and non-target species are often discarded. Discarding represents a
   potentially significant loss to the productivity of fish stocks; it can
   have damaging ecological consequences, and is a potential cause of the
   failure of recovery plans. The Nephrops fishery in the North Sea is
   classified as a mixed fishery. Nephrops trawls are constructed with
   smaller meshes than trawls used to target whitefish; consequently, the
   bycatch of juvenile fish can be substantial. Several new Nephrops trawl
   designs have been tested in the North Sea. The data from these trials
   are used to investigate the potential impact of their implementation on
   cod, haddock and whiting stocks in the North Sea (including the Kattegat
   and Skagerrak).
   The model examines five trawl designs, and also the scenarios of a
   cessation of discarding in all North Sea fisheries and in just the
   Nephrops fishery. The model is deterministic, and evaluates the relative
   differences between scenarios assuming all other variables remain
   constant. If discarding of cod, haddock and whiting in the North Sea
   fisheries were eliminated, stocks would increase by 41\%, 14\% and 29\%,
   respectively, within 10 years. Eliminating discarding in the Nephrops
   fishery alone would increase stocks by 2\%, 1\% and 13\%, respectively,
   reflecting the relative proportion of catches of these species in the
   Nephrops fishery. For cod and haddock, the introduction of the Nephrops
   trawl with a grid with a square-mesh codend was the only scenario in
   which a notable increase in stock number was observed. This trawl design
   facilitates the escape of fish of all ages/sizes from the trawl,
   effectively making the Nephrops fishery a single-species fishery. For
   whiting, stock numbers and landings increased under all scenarios, but
   forecasted landings were lower than if current discard patterns
   continued in all except the no-discards scenario. The dependency of the
   results on the validity of the assumptions and on the accuracy of the
   input data is discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Western horse mackerel stock, widely distributed in EU waters, is
   characterized by spasmodic recruitment. Currently, the strength of a
   year class cannot be confirmed before it is fully recruited to the
   fishery and has reached the age of 5 years. The only fishery-independent
   information available is an estimate of egg abundance made every third
   year. The state of the stock is considered uncertain, and there is no
   agreed management plan. Following EU requests, a set of harvest control
   rules (HCRs) that allows for the increased proportion of juvenile fish
   taken by the fishery in recent years was tested by simulation. The
   proposed HCRs are based either on the results of a full assessment
   (Constant-proportion strategy) or simply on the egg estimate used as an
   indicator of stock status (Slope strategy). Biological risk is compared
   for scenarios where: (i) uncertainty regarding stock dynamics and in the
   relationship between egg data and spawning-stock biomass is high
   (current situation); (ii) variable fractions of the total allowable
   catch (TAC) are taken in the areas occupied by juveniles and adults; and
   (iii) there is an implementation error. Results suggest that taking a
   larger portion of the TAC in the area occupied by juveniles increases
   the risk of impaired recruitment. Comparison of the Constant-proportion
   and Slope strategies suggests that the former is more conservative, if
   the assessment is unbiased or if bias is low. Given the paucity of
   fishery-independent data, a strategy resulting in an approximately
   constant catch may be appropriate for this stock.}},

Abstract = {{The quantitative criteria used by the International Union for the
   Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess risk-of-extinction are compared
   with reference points used by ICES and other fisheries organizations for
   advising on fisheries management. Criteria based on numbers of
   individuals and geographic range appear to be in harmony with limit
   reference points and control rules used in fisheries management, with
   reference points indicating that fisheries should be closed well before
   there is any risk of extinction. However, there is huge potential for
   conflict between fisheries and risk-of-extinction approaches when
   considering the extent of population declines. Of 89 species examined,
   the decline criterion suggested a serious risk-of-extinction in 87\%,
   whereas most of the stocks were still within a zone that allowed
   fisheries management reference points to indicate that exploitation
   could continue. Much of the conflict seems rooted in different types of
   tolerance to risk between the two disciplines. The conservation-biology
   community acknowledges a high tolerance for ``false alarms{''}, to keep
   the probability of a ``miss{''} very low, whereas tolerance in fisheries
   management is comparable for both types of error.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of management plans generally aim to demonstrate the
   robustness of the plans to assumptions about population dynamics and
   fleet dynamics. Such modelling is characterized by specification of an
   operating model (OM) representing the underlying truth and a management
   procedure that mimics the process of acquiring knowledge, formulating
   management decisions, and implementing those decisions. We employ such a
   model to evaluate a management plan for North Sea flatfish proposed by
   the North Sea Regional Advisory Council in May 2005. Focus is on the
   construction and conditioning of OMs, key requirements for such
   simulations. We describe the process of setting up and validating OMs
   along with its effects on the ability to communicate the results to the
   stakeholders. We conclude that there is tension between the level of
   detail required by stakeholders and the level of detail that can be
   provided. In communicating the results of simulations, it is necessary
   to make very clear how OMs depend on past perceptions of stock dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Most demersal stocks keep being overexploited despite the numerous
   management measures implemented. New approaches in methods for providing
   scientific advice to fisheries management include simulation-based MSE
   (Management Strategy Evaluation), aiming at identifying management
   strategies robust to various sources of uncertainties. MSE are
   simulation models including management scenarios and allowing for
   testing alternative plausible hypotheses about stocks and fleets
   dynamics.
   FLR (Fisheries Library in R) is an open-source collection of tools
   providing a generic modelling framework for constructing such MSE. FLR
   has been developed under the statistical computing language ``R{''} in
   EU-funded research projects, and provides various compatible packages
   which can be freely combined by the user, thus insuring complete
   flexibility.}},
