abstract = {Fisheries libraries in R (FLR) is an open-source software framework based in the R statistical software environment, with the main purpose of allowing for the efficient simulation and evaluation of fisheries management strategies. This paper details a generic (non-spatial) biological operating model used to simulate populations and their reaction to fishing, and an observation error model and methods for simulating structured sampling/observation error and bias in key fisheries assessment indices. It also contains the details of how the candidate harvest control rules, based on survey-derived information, can be characterised and implemented, and how the processes of management strategy evaluation and stock assessment can be included in the simulations.},
