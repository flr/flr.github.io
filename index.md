The **FLR** library is a collection of tools in the R statistical language that facilitates the construction of bio-economic simulation models of fisheries and ecological sytems. It is a generic toolbox, but is specifically suited for the construction of simulation models for evaluations of fisheries management strategies. The FLR library is under development by researchers across a number of laboratories and universities.
